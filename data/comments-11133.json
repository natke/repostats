        "body": "@dashesy If you've inputs on the CPU and want them to be on the GPU prior to calling Run, you need to bind each input and then call SynchronizeBoundInputs. BindInput only queues the copy operation. As stated in the C API doc, SynchronizeBoundInputs may be a no-op for some providers, but for CUDA it waits until all the input cross-device copies have been completed; it's a blocking call. So, you must call it if you intend the copies to be completed prior to Run. If you change the bound input value after Sync has been called, well, you won't see the changed value on the GPU. As for your last question, the answer is yes for now.",
