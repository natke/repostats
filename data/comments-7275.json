        "body": "@natke I think it would be best to at least mention this on the main page https://onnxruntime.ai/ installation block and add there a link directly to https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/install/\r\n\r\nCurrently, the main page even does not have any link to https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/install/, so manual navigation to docs + looking for \"install\" is needed. E.g. \"Installation Instructions\" div on the main page is not a link.\r\n\r\nSo I would say that nightly builds (and even their existence) are currently quite undiscoverable for an average user. Compare this to pytorch.org which immediate makes it clear that these builds exist",
