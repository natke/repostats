For example,  add\r\n```\r\nmessage(\"XXXXXXXXXXX\")\r\n```\r\nto https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Modules/FindPython.cmake.\r\n\r\ncmake doesn't come with a debugger. So I use this way to figure what's going on. \r\n\r\nIf you can reproduce this problem with a minimal example, for example create a sample cmake project with just \r\n```\r\nfind_package(Python 3.6 COMPONENTS Interpreter Development.Module NumPy)\r\n```\r\nIf it still fails, you can report it to the cmake community where you may get better support, because they are the specialist of cmake.
