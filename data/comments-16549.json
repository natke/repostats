        "body": "Upon trying to recreate this I realized that I may have been following the wrong steps for the setup due to the way things are linked in the documentation. It seems like the target setup instructions point to Vitis AI version 3.0 which is understandable as it has the setup guide for the embedded targets. Then once the KV260 is set up correctly following the steps detailed [here](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/3.0/html/docs/quickstart/mpsoc.html) the onnx documentation then says to follow the steps [here](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1414-vitis-ai/Programming-with-VOE). The issue then arises with the instructions on this page. \r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/assets/2663525/d6cb6071-e322-4bc2-8a8e-7c7c3a725538)\r\nThe link takes you to the documentation for version 3.5 which then states the following:\r\n- Supports ONNX Opset version 18, ONNX Runtime 1.16.0 and ONNX version 1.13\r\n- C++ and Python API (supported Python version 3)\r\n- In addition to the Vitis AI EP, you can incorporate other execution providers such as ACL EP to accelerate the inference with AMD DPU\r\n- The ONNX Runtime supports computation on the ARM64 CortexÂ®-A72 cores and the supported target is VEK280 in VAI3.5\r\n\r\nThe second and last bullet points are probable the most important ones for this issue because if we switch to the 3.0 version of the document there is no such section describing the supported hardware, nor is there a section with an example written in python. Due to the installation instruction from before we know that Vitis AI 3.0 supports the Zynq based SoCs, but they are missing from the quick start guides for Vitis AI 3.5. As such it seems like the support for python with the Zynq based SoCs is missing at the moment. This should probably be mentioned somewhere I think. Especially since I was taken to the aforementioned links through this selection:\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/assets/2663525/b538cdc8-234e-4cca-84df-71990a9f52d2)\r\n",
