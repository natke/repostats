These weights needn't be duplicated in memory and this was the motivation for shared initializers. With pre-packing, some weights are pre-processed at model load time and now the \"pre-packed\" versions of shared initializers are duplicated in memory because pre-packed buffers are owned by individual kernels, thus removing all the goodness of shared initializers in the first place. This change attempts to provide infrastructure to have pre-packed weights of shared initializers to be shared between sessions and thereby preserve the memory savings offered by shared initializers. \r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**\r\nRequired by an internal team\r\n",

When I run the Conv operator with input size of (32 * 128 * 256 * 256), profiling shows that kernel time only takes a very little part of total run time. I wonder why this phenomenon happens，and what does the cpu do during the run time except kernel time.\r\n\r\n**Urgency**\r\nUrgent\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS Linux Release 7.4\r\n- ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): source\r\n- ONNX Runtime version: 1.7.0\r\n- Python version: 3.8\r\n- Visual Studio version (if applicable):\r\n- GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): gcc5.4\r\n- CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1 cuDNN7.6\r\n- GPU model and memory: Tesla T4 and V100\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI run the Conv operator on both Tesla T4 and V100, the profiling has little difference.\r\n![微信截图_20210421093809](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31215614/115486155-a5739700-a288-11eb-9b21-8ee0f9473f70.png)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nProfiling Overview：\r\n![微信截图_20210420203855](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31215614/115486190-bc19ee00-a288-11eb-9ddd-b18eea80d8fa.png)\r\n\r\nTrue Kernel time：\r\n![微信截图_20210420203949](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31215614/115486195-bfad7500-a288-11eb-97e4-09422cb99cad.png)\r\n",

        "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nwe have an image processing application using the OpenVino GPU Backend, where we pre-allocate two tensors for our input/output:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n   OrtOpenVINOProviderOptions options;\r\n   options.device_type = \"GPU_FP32\";\r\n   options.num_of_threads = 1;\r\n   auto sessionOptions = Ort::SessionOptions();\r\n   sessionOptions.AppendExecutionProvider_OpenVINO (options);\r\n\r\n    _pSession = std::make_unique <Ort::Session>(\r\n        Ort::Session{ _env, onnxFilePath.c_str(), sessionOptions });\r\n    _memoryInfo = std::make_unique<Ort::MemoryInfo>(Ort::MemoryInfo::CreateCpu(OrtDeviceAllocator, OrtMemTypeCPU));\r\n\r\n    _output = std::make_unique<float[]> (_outputSize * 10);\r\n    _input = std::make_unique<float[]> (_inputSize * 10);\r\n    \r\n    _inputOnnxTensor = Ort::Value::CreateTensor<float>(*_memoryInfo,\r\n                                                       _input.get(), _inputSize,\r\n                                                       _inputShape.data(), _inputShape.size());\r\n    _outputOnnxTensor = Ort::Value::CreateTensor<float>(*_memoryInfo,\r\n                                                        _output.get(), _outputSize,\r\n                                                        _outputShape.data(), _outputShape.size());\r\n```\r\nand then in our processing loop, per camera frame, we run the network:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    _pSession->Run(_runOptions,\r\n                   _inputLayerNames.data(), &_inputOnnxTensor, 1,\r\n                   _outputLayerNames.data(), &_outputOnnxTensor, 1);      \r\n```                   \r\nBy overloading the new- and delete-operators, we can clearly see, that we get get a huge number of allocations (1551921) and deallocations (1332678) per frame increasing over time while executing the network. Our application timing then suffers over time due to the increasing number of allocations and memory fragmentation. I looked at the documentation, but I could not find a way for using memory-pooling or other techniques to stop the allocations per frame. \r\n\r\nIt would be great, If you can point me in the right direction. For our application I try to use memory pooling where possible, to avoid such effects.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nPhilipp\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- OS Platform and Distribution (Linux Ubuntu 20.04):\r\n- ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): From source, build with OpenVino GPU_FP32 (openvino_2021.3.394) added via CMake flags\r\n- ONNX Runtime version: 1.7.0\r\n- Python version: 3.8.5\r\n- Visual Studio version (if applicable):\r\n- GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): gcc 9.3.0\r\n- CUDA/cuDNN version: -\r\n- GPU model and memory: Intel(R) Gen9 HD Graphics NEO, OpenCL 2.1 NEO \r\n\r\n",

        "body": "There are 2 fixes in this change.\r\n\r\nIssue #1: The Microsoft.AI.MachineLearning package does not publish native binaries to the package output directory automatically.  \r\n\r\nReason: This regressed when all of the nuget payload was moved into folders with non-canonical names. This was done to prevent nuget from performing automatic copies, as its logic was getting confused when multiple binaries are produced for the same TFM (static, dynamic crt for native binaries). After moving the files to non-canonical names, all project configuration is now performed by the package itself by including its own targets/props files in the build directory. The copy that was added into the targets file only copied out to the bin directory and not the publish directory, causing the regression.\r\n\r\nFix: The Fix is to call ReferenceCopyLocalPaths on the intended binaries, and that will configure the project to binplace and publish the native binaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue #2: C# UWP Applications cannot build release because Microsoft.AI.MachineLearning.Experimental.winmd references Windows.AI.MachineLearning.winmd.\r\n\r\nReason: This happened because the core Windows AI API is implemented in a single file Windows.AI.MachineLEarning.idl, and shared between the Inbox implementation and the Redist. However, dependent idls fail to work when referencing Windows.AI.MachineLearning.idl, as import statements are interpretted as winmd references. This causes Release builds to fail, as there is no Windows.AI.MachineLearning.winmd packaged in the redist package.\r\n\r\nFix: The fix is to copy the idls into a separate folder at build, and rename them to Microsoft.* files so that midlrt does not add erroneous winmd references.",

        "body": "**Description**: This change updates the heuristics used when a thread selects which worker threads to push work to on entering a parallel loop.  Previously, worker threads would maintain a best-effort bitmap of \"good worker hints\" indicating the threads that were likely to be spinning waiting for work.  This change uses a simpler heuristic where a thread records which workers ran its previous loop, and then re-submits its next loop to those same workers.  The aim is to retain affinity between a thread and a set of workers, and to avoid maintaining the \"good worker hints\" bitmaps.  \r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**: Profiling suggested that maintaining the \"good worker hints\" was taking unexpected time, particularly on NUMA systems.  In addition, when running many concurrent workloads, the hints did not provide a way to help retain locality of workers and hence data in caches.  Testing to confirm no regressions on microbenchmark (./build/Linux/Release/onnxruntime_benchmark --benchmark_filter=BM_ThreadPoolParallelFor) and on Linux mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.onnx, comparing p50 and p99 with vs without this change:\r\n\r\n1 concurrent:\r\np50 0.0172s vs 0.0181s\r\np99 0.0204s vs 0.0216s\r\n\r\n2 concurrent:\r\np50 0.0172s vs 0.0181s\r\np99 0.0213s vs 0.0221s\r\n",

That is, with the current implementation, trying to linearly interpolate to 6 elements between 1 and 2 with an integral destination type will lead to a result of `1 1 1 1 1 2` instead of `1 1 1 2 2 2`. This behavior becomes more pathological (and further from the floating point version) the more values you try to interpolate between two close numbers.\r\n\r\nI opened an [issue](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3390) in the ONNX repo to clarify the intended behavior which is missing from the spec, but given that almost all other onnx operators use round-to-even mode I suspect that the current implementation in ORT is a bug.\r\n\r\nChanging the current implementation for `uint8/int32` would be a breaking change however.\r\n\r\n**Urgency**\r\nP2 urgency; we need this behavior clarified so that we can run a quantized mask-rcnn model.\r\n",

The intent behind this policy was to minimize allocation calls made into the heap/allocator, however, this policy can lead to memory being held for longer than needed and can impact peak memory consumption while calls made into the heap/allocator are usually cheap. This was observed in ORTModule experiments, hence, this change also turns-off memory reuse in ORTModule.",

This leads to test failures when sampling tiny points or slivers in our ONNX conformance tests. `bin_size_w` and `bin_size_h` are only multiplied anyway, not divided, and so an attempt to prevent division by zero (or whatever the original intention) is unnecessary.\r\n(2) max mode should take the *entire* bilinear sample, not a fragment of it. This line `output_val = std::max(output_val, val);` is sufficient, while the other `max` calls are wrong.\r\n(3) <i>defer this until after ONNX adds a compat attribute in https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3625</i> <s>input pixel alignment is 0.5 off - the correct equation is `(x + 0.5) * scale - 0.5`, but the final 0.5 was missed `(x + 0.5) * scale` (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).</s> \r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**\r\n- _Why is this change required? What problem does it solve?_ The DML/WinML ONNX conformance tests fail on CPU for a number of cases.\r\n- _If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here._ https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/6921 (also related https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3428)",

This tensor is also used in a reduction.  In MIOpen, it dynamically generates and compiles a reduction kernel for each shape/datatype/etc.:\r\nhttps://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/blob/1673b9f0ff6148f1972080240a70c73b5915ff0b/src/reducetensor.cpp#L485-L553\r\n\r\nThis causes noticeable slowdowns (~2s per kernel generation).  To workaround this, we can use the built-in `reduce_sum()` for special cases like reduce-all to scalar.  This reduction kernel is already heavily optimized for this case, so there's no performance issue.",

That caused a trouble that they can't use our python frontend unless they hack it by some patch.\r\n- Taking the latest tech that build EP as shared library, we can build the out of tree EPs as shared library, then load into ort session through provider options. this allow the internal user use the out of tree EP without hack onnxruntime python package.\r\n",

        "body": "Hi there. I'm having issues appending an OpenVino EP on a C# console app targeting .NET 5-windows.\r\n\r\nI am invoking as \r\n`            SessionOptions options = new SessionOptions();\r\n            string device= \"CPU_FP32\";\r\n            options.GraphOptimizationLevel = GraphOptimizationLevel.ORT_ENABLE_ALL;\r\n            options.AppendExecutionProvider_OpenVINO(device);\r\n`\r\nCrash happens on the append call. I am building from source using \r\n.\\build.bat --config Release  --parallel --cmake_generator \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" --build_nuget  --use_openvino CPU_FP32 --build --update\r\n\r\nOpenVINO version is 2021.3\r\n\r\nbut any version of config (Release, Debug, RelWithDebIngo), or any device ID, or any combination of --build --update etc results in the same behavior. I'm not sure if this is related, but the only two nugets that are generated with these configs are Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed, and Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.OpenVINO, not Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I can't test it on a CPP app either because the OpenVINO nuget does not define targets. Nor does it work with -build_wheel. I'm using the setupvars scrips and am using the latest openVINO library. I've kind of exhausted all possible avenues to debug this so I'm wondering if there's anyone who could assist. I've followed all the build instructions to a tee and still can't get this to work properly. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n",

        "body": "# **Overview:**\r\nImplements partial graph execution feature to enable ORTModule coordination with PyTorch using a _single_ thread instead of _two_ threads as in the current master. Allows a sub-graph to be executed in a _PartialRun_ call which returns the state of the graph in addition to fetches. The state essentially holds on to intermediate tensors. Keeping the state around keeps things performant by avoiding exchanging intermediate tensors back and forth between subsequent partial graph run calls that can add significant overhead. It also simplifies the design.\r\n\r\nSupersedes https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/7077 by keeping stuff stateless inside ONNX Runtime.\r\n\r\n# **Block diagram:**\r\n\r\n![partial_graph_execution-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1211949/116354311-147f4d00-a7ad-11eb-996b-e029388e94fc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## **ORTModule:**\r\nThe python front-end for ONNX Runtime Training. It creates an ORT session that represents an ONNX graph to train on. Then using RunForward and RunBackward calls the training is conducted. A pair of RunForward and RunBackward calls is represented by a state called RunCtx, this state also contains PartialGraphExecutionState that captures the state of the graph after a partial graph run in ORT. Using this state the graph execution can be resumed. This state is essentially a list of intermediate tensors that are produced during a graph run. \r\n\r\n## **Training Agent:**\r\nThis acts as the proxy to C++ backend of ORT. It is a C++ layer that interacts with ORTModule using pybind. \r\n\r\n## **Inference Session:**\r\nThis is the entry point into ORT backend. It contains the PartialRun call that partially runs through a graph using a list of feeds and returns a list of fetches (if any). It invokes Partial Executor that either initializes or updates an existing Partial Graph Execution state with Execution Frame that contains list of intermediate tensors. \r\n\r\n\r\n# **Performance benefits:**\r\nWe are seeing **2.73% speed/throughput improvements** using partial graph execution change over master on zcode model.\r\n\r\nIn the below graph after running for 4.6K steps the throughput is as following:\r\n\r\n1. Magenta line is PyTorch baseline: **3.197e+4**\r\n2. Grey line is master from 04/15 with symbolic fix: **3.1979e+4**\r\n3. Teal line is the same master commit from 04/15 + symbolic fix + partial graph execution change: **3.2863e+4**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1211949/115932756-6a1cc800-a442-11eb-8939-1fb748c60dcd.png)\r\n\r\n",

Now we execute these GEMMs in parallel, removing barriers between two adjacent GEMM operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance tested with Bert and T5 model. Bert model shows no noticeable perf differences, as the heavy lifting is done by the attention operator, which is not changed in this PR. In T5 model, we see no regression on low parallel threads (x4), and performance improvement is more pronounced in high number of threads (8-16). T5 shows 10% speedup with 16 threads. With profiling, we can see the most expensive MatMul operators in T5 achieves around 20% speedup with 16 threads.",

We were expecting to ship TensorRT support in QAS in April, but it is now blocked by this issue since we have multi-GPU machines at production, which would be impacted by this issue.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows Server 2019 Datacenter\r\n- ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): source\r\n- ONNX Runtime version: master (4971310d6aaf90452a72856670db4b5e6b74e0e6)\r\n- Python version: N/A\r\n- Visual Studio version (if applicable): 2019\r\n- GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): msbuild 16.9.0.16703\r\n- CUDA version:10.2\r\n- cuDNN version: 8.0.4\r\n- TensorRT version: 7.2.2\r\n- GPU model and memory:V100/32G (the machine has 8 V100 GPUs.)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- Describe steps/code to reproduce the behavior.\r\n1. Load the same model to all the 8 GPUs (via 8 separate sessions).\r\n2. Execute the model in parallel for all the 8 sessions at the same time.\r\nAccess violation error being thrown when building engine from this line: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/8d737f977056444a307f1b7f0bcd402fba62d790/onnxruntime/core/providers/tensorrt/tensorrt_execution_provider.cc#L1507\r\n\r\nHowever, if I send the initial request (which triggers engine building) to each GPU sequentially, then no exception happens.\r\n\r\n- Attach the ONNX model to the issue (where applicable) to expedite investigation.\r\n(MSFT VPN required) \\\\LIFU-DESKTOP\\shared\\bert_exp17.onnx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3427331/114591408-b3009f80-9c3e-11eb-819a-eced94994201.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here. If the issue is about a particular model, please share the model details as well to facilitate debugging.\r\n\r\nI have a VM where this issue can be repro. Please feel free to contact me offline if needed. (alias:lifhuan)\r\n",
