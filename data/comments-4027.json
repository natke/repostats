I prefer to use docker and [packer](https://www.packer.io/) to do these job, because they're more reproducible.\r\n\r\nOur team(onnxruntime team) is very diverse.  I would like to allow people using the tools they like, instead of forcing everyone sticking to a single tool/workflow. From what I can see, most of the devs they like the python script. So I don't have a motivation to replace it. \r\n\r\nWould you please let me know what blocks you? If there is anything I can help, please let me know. onnxruntime supports parallel build. Because it is built on cmake, so inherently it works.  \r\n",

        "body": "I'll describe my situation for better context. I'm working with a team on a C++ project and we'd like to use onnxruntime. We use cmake to build everything (including dependencies) from source. Since onnxruntime does not have a top-level `CMakeList.txt` (relevant issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/3124)), I'm trying to figure out what the best path forward is to integrate onnxruntime into the project.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have cmake clone the repo and call the python build script. It's not the cleanest solution, but it works. The [build instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/BUILD.md) recommend using the build.sh script which calls the python script.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the python script, can you elaborate on your build workflow? Once third-party dependencies are installed, what cmake script are you calling to build the onnxruntime repo?",
