I also tried to write to %TEMP% and was able to do so however I encountered the same error when instantiating `InferenceSession`. The [documentation](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Understanding-the-Azure-App-Service-file-system) of Azure says those file systems should be accessible.\r\n\r\nThis might be same with #1174 where error occurs on `GetInputName` but I'm not entirely sure. Is there a code in there that might cause this?\r\n\r\nAnother side question, is there any plan to instantiate an `InferenceSession` from a `Stream`? This can solve issues accessing the file system.",

It's not the same as a  stream, but at least you don't have to write the model out to disk.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.h#L192",
