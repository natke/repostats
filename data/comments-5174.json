        "body": "Hello, there are changes in the tracysh/qlinearconv_u8s8 branch that enables a QLinearConv with activations=u8 and weights=s8. This implementation supports per-channel quantization, however only symmetric quantization, so the zero points for the weight tensor must be zero. These changes will be merged to master after the 1.5 release has branched.",
