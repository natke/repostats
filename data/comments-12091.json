When I tried to run your code and open the onnx file in netron. The output I'm getting is this.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25060086/206358080-4dda922e-6f84-4f32-92cd-8cb58f9d48a7.png)\r\n\r\nAccording to your code and the image of the graph you share you are getting the final shape in Resize Layer but when I go to the properties I'm getting [unknown_dim_0,unknown_dim_1,unknown_dim_2,unknown_dim_3] but in your onnx file the output from the resize block is [1,1,511,1,1] and the graph looks like this.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25060086/206358444-0625eab1-ef43-4b17-9905-59757bf6564b.png)\r\n\r\nI want the dimension to be displayed between the Resize and output y. I ran the code which you gave so what else did you change in your code to generate the output dimension from the Resize Block?",
