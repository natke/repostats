I tried to convert the model to ORT as well, does it fine but it does not load anyways, because of \"integet64 not supported\". A shame because the model is quite accurate. \r\n\r\nIf what you are planning to check is the support for the operators, I converted the model from here (i think it is the best way to check): https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX they provide the pytorch weights in the readme. That should be uploadable to **netron**.\r\n\r\nI can share the exact **model.onnx** files or pictures (from Netron) to you but not publicly because it is a private project.\r\n\r\nPlease, let me know.",
