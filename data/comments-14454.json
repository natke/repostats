        "body": "@scottmckay Thanks for your reply! It's exported from PyTorch, so, as I understand it, each node is automatically named with the name of the module it belongs to, and if there are more than one of the same node type in a module, they are named sequentially, which is why I was expecting `Transpose_719` to be the 719th transpose node in some kind of context (e.g., nodes could hypothetically be renamed internally when loaded onto the GPU, or something else I'm unaware of).\r\n\r\nThe graph has no subgraphs, no conditionals or flow control operators, etc. Searching for `Transpose_719`, `Transpose_15` or `Concat_718` in Netron comes up with nothing. There are Transpose and Concat nodes, but the highest number is 4 (i.e., no PyTorch module had more than 4 Transposes), with maybe 15 or 16 Transposes in total.",
