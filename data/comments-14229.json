Then the activation type should be different for tensorrt.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply!\r\nTo be honest, I don't really understand the issue you mentioned, and I don't find any operator named Scale from onnx operator list.ðŸ˜¢\r\n\r\nI found that the inputs of DQ operator for bias are:\r\n- x: int32\r\n- x_scale: float32\r\n- x_zero_point: int32\r\n\r\nAnd the inputs of DQ operators for weight are:\r\n- x: int8\r\n- x_scale: float32\r\n- x_zero_point: int8\r\n\r\nThey are all acceptable for the DQ operator as below.\r\n<img width=\"461\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12782861/211821901-7572485e-57c0-408e-8142-522f1d7c036b.png\">\r\n\r\nSo I think maybe this is not about the dypte of inputs as the issue you mentioned.\r\n\r\nBefore I added `extra_options={'AddQDQPairToWeight': True}` to quantize_static, the error message was raised at the DQ operator before weights like this issue #11535. Therefore I think maybe after I add QDQ pairs to bias this problem could be solved.",
