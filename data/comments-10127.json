However, if some features of onnxruntime are unavailable in torch_ort, then installing onnxruntime first and then installing torch_ort eliminates the problem.  ",

It threw the error.\r\n\r\nBut not tried `pip install torch_ort -I` and I could import without any error.\r\nBut if I do `pip install onnxruntime -I`  it throws an error, and if I do the above again, it works fine\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure why this happens. I hope this is good enough info.",
