        "body": "This feature didn't make it into release `v1.15.*` AFAICT. So the opset 19 support claimed in the [compatibility documentation](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/reference/compatibility.html) is not fully met IIUC. Was this left out intentionally or just missed?\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, graphs generated with ONNX 1.14 cannot be run with ORT 1.15. Cherry-picking onto the `v1.15.1` tag and then running the ONNX 1.14 graph works.\r\n\r\nAny chance that this can get into a `v1.15.2` point release? I would really appreciate that. Thanks for implementing it! :)\r\n\r\nFriendly ping @snnn, because you ran the `v1.15.*` release.",
