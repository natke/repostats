        "body": "@abuvaneswari, many of the performance problems are related to the MaxPool operator. The resnet50_v1.onnx model from ORT 1.6 as well as your SSD model has a number of MaxPool nodes. The latest main branch has faster support for MaxPool, but the model needs to be exported with opset 12. Opset 12 adds a definition for MaxPool that works with quantized uint8 types.\r\n\r\nI was seeing the quantized opset 10 resnet50_v1.onnx take 29ms against a 27ms FP32 model, but after switching to opset 12, the quantized model was getting down to 24ms. I'm seeing an improvement using your model with the latest, but it wasn't quite at FP32 performance yet.",
