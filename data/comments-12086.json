        "body": "To give slightly more context, we run our software on dozens of servers, and the nightly tests where we saw these differences seemed to indicate that the behavior was CPU dependent. For example, the last few nights: \r\n\r\nJuly 3 -> s+Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216 CPU @ 2.10GHz 22528 KB+AVX2\r\nJuly 2 -> s+AMD EPYC 7302 16-Core Processor 512 KB+AVX2\r\nJuly 1 -> s+AMD EPYC 7302 16-Core Processor 512 KB+AVX2\r\nJune 30 -> s+Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218 CPU @ 2.30GHz 22528 KB+AVX2\r\nJune 29 -> s+Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v4 @ 2.20GHz 25600 KB+AVX2\r\n\r\nbetween the 1st and 2nd we saw no differences. \r\n\r\nSince we build from source we're more than happy to introduce any additional compiler flags, even if that limits throughput significantly. (We could easily tolerate a factor of 2, while a factor of 10 might be a bit of a problem but better than CPU dependant results. Most of the CPU is spent in non-ML parts of the code.)",
