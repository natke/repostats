        "body": "@SangbumChoi I didn't solve it - I'm wondering if it's possible to \"dequantize\" it on the client. The main reason I want the model quantized is to reduce the time it takes for the client to download it.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is the WebGL backend is just missing a lot of ops compared to Wasm backend. The unquantized version of my model also has `Erf` - [just like yours, apparently](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/13729), which the WebGL backend doesn't support.\r\n\r\nLike I said in my first comment on this issue, I hope that WebGPU will solve these compatibility problems by just compiling the native GPU code to WGSL, so we have ~full op support without lots of burden on the ONNX Runtime Web team.",
