Is there any specific version of `onnxmltools` that you would recommend us to downgrade to ? Also could you elaborate the below a bit so that it will facilitate us to check if we can make any tweaks on the model side ?\r\n`means the conversion went wrong, one tree is pointing to another one when dealing with missing value`",

I have tried today multiple times with new models of same configuration and also switched the model loading from file to inline using `SerializeToString` method during inference (that was the only notable difference between your version of the code and mine). I am still facing the same error.\r\nAlso would like to know whether the model file that I had shared, did not throw any errors during inference ?\r\nAnd if possible would request you to share one of the ONNX exported models generated by you which work fine on your side. I am not sure if the versions of all the components involved match between your trials and my trials.",

I am using *skl2onnx* version *1.8.0*. I should be able to change this to any specific version you can point me to.\r\nAlso FYI the attached *model.onnx* file does work fine for inference in my setup too. It might help investigate further if you could share the dependency versions you are using to perform the export to onnx, preferably the result `pip freeze` or `conda list` or that of any specific dependencies you deem fit to be looked into ?\r\n\r\nI have also attached details of my python environment as a file.\r\n[requirements.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/files/6693666/requirements.txt)\r\n",
