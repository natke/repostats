It is difficult to say more without knowing more about the model itself. You may use a function like this one https://onnx.ai/onnx/api/tools.html#replace-initializer-by-constant-of-shape to make your model lighter and avoid sharing the weights.",

I want to convert to an onnx model with its size still retain as 111 MB, as I suspect when compressing to an 37 MB onnx model, parameter precision was lost.",
