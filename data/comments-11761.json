Also, the image resize is using `512x512`, how does it agree with ` `512 * 512 * 3` ?",

I am extracting the input/ouput tensor shapes from the model so that I know what shapes the model is expecting.\r\n\r\nImages are in RGB format which need 3 bytes for each pixel. Thats why it fits with 512 * 512 * 3. Also when the input tensor size doesn't fit then there will be an error message.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am seeing is that one ONNX model for ObjectDetection is working in Python and C++ (using the posted c++ code) and another ONNX model  for ObjectDetection is working in python but not in C++(using the posted c++ code).\r\nAnd that's what this issue report is about.\r\n\r\nI am wondering why this is the case and unfortunatelly there is only very little example code showing how to properly use ONNX in C++.\r\n",
