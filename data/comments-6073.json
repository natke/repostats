        "body": "I ran into this issue as well. After commit 24016a5 `Gemm` uses pre-packed weights for initializers that are constant; how does this interact with the weight update from `SGDOptimizer`? Once `SGDOptimizer` assigns the updated weights, the pre-packed weights should no longer be used. Have not debugged too deeply, but is there any mechanism currently in place to enforce this?\r\n\r\nAlternatively instead of discarding pre-packed weights upon a weight update, perhaps pre-packing should not be done in the first place for weights that are to be trained. @liqunfu A method could be added to check whether a given \"input_idx\" of a node is a weight that is being trained.",
