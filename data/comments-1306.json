Our network speed is even faster than local disk, which is much faster than any data compression algorithm.  I saw no value here to waste cpu time just for saving 10% bandwidth. As I pointed before, on our build machines, the downloading only takes 2 minutes. So even you can optimize it to 1min 48sec without extra cost, It's not worth for me . Because the whole build takes more than 1 hour. A few seconds improvement is not observable.",
