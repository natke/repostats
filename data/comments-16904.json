        "body": "You are right. The \"16+\" is actually very misleading. The plus sign means starting from opset 16 until it gets changed.  For example, now the opset 20 is not released yet, the if operator in opset20 could be anything. Any part of it could be changed, except the name. It's like: after a reincarnation, who will be I? nobody knows. Therefore, an onnx runtime release cannot claim it will support an opset that is not known at the time when the onnx runtime version is released.  See this comment: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/onnxruntime/core/framework/kernel_registry.cc#L128 In ONNX Runtime's source when a kernel is registered, either it is registered to a specific version, or it is registered to a version range but the right side of the range cannot be open ended.  So, basically the \"16+\" means just opset 16. If an op is not changed in a newer opset, surely the existing code will continue to work. That's the plus sign means. ",
