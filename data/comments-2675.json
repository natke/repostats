        "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR",
        "body": "After some playing around for a bit (disclaimer I work primarily in java and I am not a regular user of cmake), I was able to compile it, albeit for a single architecture (linux 64bit). My mac build env is a mess unrelated to anything here, so I have not built it there yet. I did test the java functionality briefly. We are going to stress test and do additional checks before we consider using your library.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the longer term vision of how this should be distributed, here are my thoughts. It should be released to maven, preferably maven central repository. This makes it very easy for users to incorporate it into it their projects. Snapshots are a nice to have, but I guess technically not a requirement. I see that the azure pipeline seems to have a release and snapshot mechanism for the python library. Ideally, Java would have a similar mechanism. I guess the project maintainers would probably handle this.\r\n\r\nThere are some nuances in the actual artifacts that are published to maven. Specifically there is the nature of how different architectures (linux, windows, mac, etc) are handled. Typically the maven classifier is used to differentiate artifacts based on OS/arch. Additionally there is the other issue of how much to bundle in the artifact. \r\n\r\nI was looking at the \"onnxruntime4j-1.1.0-with-binaries.jar\" it contains both the libonnxruntime.so and libonnxruntime4j_jni.so\r\n\r\nI think we should approach this more like bytedeco's javacpp presets handles it: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/bytedeco/opencv/4.1.2-1.5.2/ Feel free to download a few different jar's and run `unzip -l whatever.jar` to see what each contains.\r\n\r\nThere is a base artifact with the java classes. This would be like the plain onnxruntime4j-1.1.0.jar. Then there are a series of artifacts with classifiers for the different os/arch. Each of those would contain the libonnxruntime4j_jni.so or libonnxruntime4j_jni.dylib or onnxruntime4j_jni.dll respectively. Alternatively you could forego the classifiers and put them all in one jar, but this is probably against best practice (polluting the java class path with unused data) and may be difficult to have your azure pipeline do since it seems to be split up by arch.\r\n\r\nThere is another question about whether whether whatever is published should contain a compiled onnxruntime library. Probably for most users this would be desired as an easy quick start. However power users may want to provide their own onnxruntime library. I believe it may be possible to accomplish this by breaking out into another artifact: one with just the onnxruntime library that depends on a core artifact containing Java classes and points towards classified artifacts containing the onnxruntime4j_jni library.\r\n\r\nIdeally, these are the following artifacts:\r\n\r\n* group: ai.onnx name: runtime-cpu version: 1.1.0 _= This artifact would be used when the user wants a stock CPU onnxruntime library for whatever os they desire. This would be like the library available from the repo's releases page in the download area. This artifact would depend on the runtime-core artifact below. The POM refers to the following classified artifacts:_\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-cpu version: 1.1.0 classifier: macosx-x86_64\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-cpu version: 1.1.0 classifier: linux-x86_64\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-cpu version: 1.1.0 classifier: windows-x86_64\r\n* group: ai.onnx name: runtime-gpu version: 1.1.0 _= This artifact would be used when the user wants a stock GPU onnxruntime library for whatever os they desire. This would be like the library available from the repo's releases page in the download area. This artifact would depend on the runtime-core artifact below. The POM refers to the following classified artifacts:_\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-gpu version: 1.1.0 classifier: macosx-x86_64\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-gpu version: 1.1.0 classifier: linux-x86_64\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-gpu version: 1.1.0 classifier: windows-x86_64\r\n* group: ai.onnx name: runtime-core version: 1.1.0 = _This artifact would contain the java classes and a loader much like the one that currently exists in OnnxRuntime.java. The POM refers to the following classified artifacts. Each of these would contain the relevant onnxruntime4j_jni library for that os/arch._\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-core version: 1.1.0 classifier: macosx-x86_64\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-core version: 1.1.0 classifier: linux-x86_64\r\n  - group: ai.onnx name: runtime-core version: 1.1.0 classifier: windows-x86_64\r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\n* User wants to get started on a cpu with no customization: use `runtime-cpu`\r\n* User wants to get started on a gpu with no customization: use `runtime-gpu`\r\n* User wants to provide their own onnxruntime library: use `runtime-core`\r\n\r\nTo accommodate  that last case, it may be necessary to refactor OnnxRuntime.java to try loading the onnxruntime from the resources first if it is present. onnxruntime4j_jni would be loaded always. \r\nThe developer could have loaded onnxruntime using a System.load or System.loadLibrary prior, in that case the link dependency would already be satisfied. If it was not already loaded, then I believe the java lib path is used. If no onnxruntime lib was found, then onnxruntime4j_jni would throw an unsatisfued link exception.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any other questions or ideas.",

        "body": "> The JNI binding needs to be compiled using the same flags as the onnx runtime native library\r\n\r\nI see where you're coming from, but no, it doesn't. You're wrong. In fact, JNI bindings sometimes require a different set of flags than the rest of the code. CMake, Bazel, Autoconf, etc don't come with any special support for JNI for that. We need to tack these things on manually anyway, so why not do everything in one single place, such as with a tool like JavaCPP with it's own little \"build system\" for JNI, which we can also use as a plugin for Maven, Gradle, etc to build alongside Java source files? That makes much more sense to me than adding proper support for JNI and Java to all native build tools! I also discussed the value of this with @karllessard previously, see https://github.com/karllessard/tensorflow-java-sandbox/pull/2#discussion_r324419131.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thinking about it some more, the C API is fine for what we need for our own applications, for\r\nhttps://github.com/KonduitAI/konduit-serving/issues/212. The Java bindings that you're offering in this repository are geared towards idiomatic Java, but we're not going to have our users use ONNX Runtime directly anyway and JavaCPP gets us 90% of the way in terms of usability of the resulting Java API. However, in production, we do care about performance, which isn't one of your goals here, so it doesn't make sense to rely on bindings that doesn't allow us to meet our targets. JavaCPP does prioritize performance, and it's typically even faster than manually written JNI, for example, see https://github.com/tensorflow/java/pull/18#issuecomment-579600568. Moreover, as a company, we can't honestly support a system that has as many known issues as listed on pull https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/2215#issuecomment-545243304, and that you still refuse to do anything about.\r\n\r\nGiven your employer, you should know about the importance of all this for enterprises. In the meantime though, the C API is fine us, but for the sake of the community, I do hope one day you understand the issues at play here.",

The C/C++ APIs of ONNX Runtime does in fact support that just fine.

For Python, we have tools like conda, pip, cython, pybind11, etc that everyone uses. But for some reason that I still don't understand, people like you at Oracle and OpenJDK feel that, in the case of Java, it's perfectly alright for everyone to reinvent the wheel and build everything from scratch. That isn't going to work! In my opinion, you'll need to do something about it, sooner or later.",
