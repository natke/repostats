Any guidance on rectifying the issue would be appreciated.\r\nOr if any other alternative ways to approach the overall task, do let me know.\r\n\r\nLike the Linux version, just in case if your team has any precompiled .so files for Android with Android ABI: arm64-v8a and Android API: 28 do let me know.",
