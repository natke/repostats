I guess it would also make sense to allign the input. I can't come up with some exact scenario, but since the user can use it, someone might want to use it to create a texture at some point.\r\n\r\nI guessed there is something else going on, other than just cudaMalloc, when calling the Ort::Allocator. Documentation is not exactly detailed regarding this. But if that is not the case I can allocate it myself using standard cudaMalloc. That sounds like a simplest workaround, other workaround I found is creating another array and copying data to it, since copy works regardles og the alignment. But I don't like adding extra unnecessary operations.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I really feel like either documentation should be more explicit regarding this, or it should be properly aligned by default (second seems much better). When it does happen, it is a hard bug to find.",
