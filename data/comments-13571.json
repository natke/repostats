It can then be used in multiple threads to inference the same model.\r\n- `OrtEnv` needs to be created only once per process (regardless of the # of models you're inferencing).\r\n\r\nYour pseudo-code looks like it should work, however, can you please provide the specific code you're using to create and run the session, so that the issue can be reproduced? Thank you.",
