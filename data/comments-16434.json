Try creating the environment first, and I'll add a static init block to `SessionOptions` to ensure you at least get an ORT error if you do it. The environment needs to be created before everything else as it sets up things like logging, but it's not a part of the `SessionOptions` constructor so there's nothing in the code to prevent you from doing that.",

This kind of lazy native library loading idiom is very common in the Java ML space, it's used in XGBoost, TF, ORT and several other places.\r\n\r\nThe linker error is due to something in your build not packaging the native library correctly, but unfortunately I don't know anything about how Android packages native libraries so someone else will have to help you with that.",

        "body": "> > Ok, I just unpackaged the native libraries again like when I was working with the C++, and now it works. Is there a reason why I have to do this manually rather than just using the library AAR directly through gradle like your instructions say to for Java builds? If not, the instructions should be more clear about the need to unpackage them for all builds.\r\n> \r\n> May I know which directory you put the libonnxruntime4j_jni.so under? I'm also facing the same issue now. Thanks!\r\n\r\nSure. In your src folder use the following directory structure:\r\n> main\r\n>>jniLibs\r\n>>>arm64-v8a\r\n>>>armeabi-v7a\r\n>>>v86\r\n>>>v86_64\r\n\r\n",
