        "body": "I am sure you have good reasons to convert the providers to shared lib, but I see a serious issue and I might be wrong. The issue is now, you need to ship the provider.so with your package and this is not an issue with Windows but with Linux. In Linux you need to install the provider.so in LD_LIBRARY_PATH folder. Now assume there are two different products from different vendors, each shipped with their own provider.so which might linked against different version of onnxruntime, say 1.5 and 1.6. The first choice for any vendor to install its provider.so would be `/usr/local/lib` for example and here we face the first problem. The problem is a package manager such as deb or rpm does not let the second package to be installed since it's going to override the provider.so from the first package. Even if, by some luck, each package installs its provider.so in different path, now you face the second issue when to get to run the actual application. We now have two different versions of the provider.so in our LD_LIBRARY_PATH and depends on the order of which .so gets loaded first, the application may run properly or crashes.\r\nPlease advise whether my thinking is right or wrong.",

This should allow for multiple version to coexist just fine as nobody pollutes LD_LIBRARY_PATH and nobody would mix different libraries within the same directory.
