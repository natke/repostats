        "body": "Thanks for the explanation. My case is actually the former. It's a super resolution model that accepts variable width and height. So I think I won't be able to do much to make it runnable on NNAPI if it remains dynamic.\r\n\r\nI've also tried converting the model to accept static input shapes and padding images so they have uniform shapes. However, upon running on NNAPI, there was a layer/operation that isn't compatible with NNAPI, namely a `DepthToSpace` layer. Because of this, I think ultimately the model just won't run on NNAPI given its architectural design. The only solution to that is when NNAPI supports the layer sometime in the future, I think.",
