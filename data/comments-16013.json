        "body": "> Can you elaborate more on your use case?\r\n\r\nI am deploying a singing voice synthesis project to ONNX. The architecture includes:\r\n- a linguistic encoder which takes lyrics and rhythms as input\r\n- a duration predictor that predicts the phoneme durations\r\n- a pitch predictor that predicts pitch according to music scores and phoneme durations\r\n\r\nLyrics and rhythms are firstly encoded into hidden units, and both of the predictors take these hidden units as input; the phoneme durations can also be given by user in some interactive scenarios. That is to say, the user gets phoneme durations from the model, edits them, and then input them back into the model to get the pitch; or he/she gets both the durations and the pitch in one go.\r\n\r\nThe problem is: when the user needs the durations, he/she will expect the model to be very fast. The duration predictor itself is lightweight and fast, but the pitch predictor is diffusion-based and will not likely run that fast. If all nodes are forced to be executed in every run, the speed and the waste of computation resources becomes unacceptable.\r\n\r\n> does modifying the model work?\r\n\r\nThis works technically, just as I currently do; I split these parts of the model into different ONNX files. However, this may confuse and mislead some of my users.\r\n\r\nAssume one of my users have two models in PyTorch, A and B. He exports both A and B to ONNX, and he gets two sets of .onnx files. The two predictors are exported separately, and he may think those models are replaceable. For example, if he thinks pitch predictor A is better than B, but duration predictor B is better than A, he may copy and replace pitch predictor B with pitch predictor A. But this will not work - pitch predictor A can only work with linguistic encoder A - all he gets will be noises.\r\n\r\nMost of my users does not know much about deep learning. To avoid this kind of misunderstanding, I have to tell them that these models cannot be mixed up, but I still cannot make sure all my users will see this warning.\r\n\r\nAllowing only executing through the required path in ONNX Runtime may help relieve these troubles. It is not a serious problem though.",
