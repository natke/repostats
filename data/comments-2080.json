The error message (and especially the fact that it only repros for certain strings) is symptomatic of this problem - \r\n\r\n\" indices element out of data bounds, idx=6157 data_dim=6148 \"\r\n\r\n Please check the necessary input string length requirement (long strings may have to be truncated and short string may have to be padded). \r\n\r\nIf after this investigation and fix, it still continues to fail, please re-open the issue with the ONNX model and a sample failure string (if you are unable to share customer query string, please share a dummy string with the same length) and I think that should help us debug.\r\n\r\nClosing this out for now.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n",
