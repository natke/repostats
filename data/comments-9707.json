I am not sure what the problem actually is about, but it finally works. What worked for me more: installing **\"Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.MKLML\"** package(int this case without **\"Microsoft.ML.Mkl.Redist\"**). Issue still is mysterious. I think i would better not touch any packages regarding **onnx** so that i won't have any problems in the future. Thank you!",

This code is responsible for creating a nuspec that is then packaged, and it creates the native runtimes folders for MacOS in a way that is specific to 10.14, as recorded above by @juwens. If this were changed to just `osx-%s`, you'd get a package that works correctly for all OSX consumers (at least barring any actual OS requirements on the part of the native code).  This would be in line with how the `win` and `linux` platforms are provided as general baselines as well.\r\n\r\nTo test this, users can manually copy the `osx.10.14-x64` directory from the package runtimes in their nuget cache (`~/.nuget/package/microsoft.ml.onnxruntime/1.10.0` is the default location) to a sibling folder called `osx-x64`, then purge their obj and bin directories and re-publish their applications. At this point the application should run. I verified this offline with @khalidabuhakmeh.",

There's something we need to do in the SDK/Build/Runtime side of things to make make this scenario work. I'll keep running this down, and when we have a root cause or plan I'll be sure to link it here. In the mean time, for users of this package, if you're on an OSX version greater than 10.14, continue to explicitly specify your runtime identifier via either setting the `RuntimeIdentifier` MSBuild property in your project files, or explicitly on your command lines via `--os osx.<version number>`.",

In fact `Environment.GetEnviromentVariable(\"DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\")` returned `null` when doing so.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, as it is a dotnet runtime issue, as exception says that it tried searching specific paths, and they are probably somewhat hardcoded for macOS, and PATH environment variable not being respected. \r\nFor Apple Silicon Macs, homebrew does not install references into `/usr/local/bin` anymore, so it could be a source of this failure.",
