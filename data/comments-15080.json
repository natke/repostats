Just hire someone to do it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm hearing is \"we agree Onnxruntime is inefficient and we don't want to fix it.\" Is that really the Microsoft attitude? 😁\r\n\r\nI jest, of course. I'm sure you could all fix it in a weekend of hacking if you put your minds to it. \r\n\r\nUsing double the amount of RAM needed is the very definition of inefficient code.\r\n\r\nWhy not just load the Onnx file layer by layer and convert it into the desired type layer by layer? Then delete from RAM as we go along. Doesn't seem impossible, just seems like different departments need to work together.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems like you're saying ONNX itself is flawed because it uses protobuf format. So maybe we shouldn't be using Onnxruntime at all?\r\n\r\nAs I say, pytorch manages to not uses double the amount of memory or VRAM so it's definitely possible.\r\n\r\n\"The bulk of the memory is the initializer/weights data which may be stored in a packed format\". OK, well once a layer has been converted into the format needed to run the model, delete the packet. What's so hard about that? Do it layer by layer to avoid the spike.",

        "body": "> @pauldog If memory is a concern you can solve it the following way.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Create a session with the model by setting the optimized_file_path to serialize the optimized model file.\r\n> 2. Externalize all weights from the optimized model.\r\n> 3. Create OrtValues for each of the weights.\r\n> 4. Feed them to ORT using [this API](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/c6074f3a4b09cb44b46ca4422717deb067015bfa/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.h#L2440-L2441). Even though this API was originally developed to share weights between multiple models (sessions), it can still be used with a single session. It'll ensure the weights are allocated **only once** (by the user). Here's a [test](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/59dfcfdce712a5d527c7b986fc41a8e4e14c702a/onnxruntime/test/shared_lib/test_inference.cc#L2261) that shows its usage.\r\n\r\nHi can you clarify what you mean by \"externalize all weights\"? I'm not sure I understand thanks.",
