Technically the EP has very partial 16 support (for operators whose signature didn't change functionally and just added additional data types) and the DFT-17 op, but officially opset 15 is the last supported opset. Because DirectML.dll is a separate component on its own schedule (and is a redist but also an operating system component), it has a longer lead time than ORT's regular quarterly cadence. It's on the roadmap though... (FYI @martinb35 for future feature requests)",
