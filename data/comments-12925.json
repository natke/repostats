        "body": "It is expected. Let's just assume quantization can achieve 4 more times parallelism than full precision. According to [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law) and assuming the parallelism portion is 0.6, then:\r\n- with 1 thread,  quant gets 1/(0.4 + 0.6/4) = 1.82x speedup and fp32 gets 1x speedup. Then quant/fp32 = 1.82x. It is quite similar to your case.\r\n- with 2 threads, quant gets 1/(0.4 + 0.6/(4*2)) = 2.1x speedup and fp32 gets 1/(0.4 + 0.6/2) = 1.43x. Then quant/fp32 = 2.1/1.43  = 1.47x.\r\n- with 4 threads, quant gets 1/(0.4 + 0.6/(4*4)) = 2.29x speedup and fp32 gets 1/(0.4 + 0.6/4) = 1.82x. Then quant/fp32 = 1.26x.\r\n\r\nThis is simple model, but it can explain why quant get less speedup with more threads. In addition, quant also introduces extra overhead(quantize and dequantize) which makes quant's parallelism portion smaller. ",
