        "body": "Onnxruntime always takes `OrtValue`s as inputs and returns the same as outputs.\r\n`OrtValue` are containers (discriminated unions) that may contain one of the following tensors, sparse_tensors, maps, and sequences. The latter two are composite and potentially recursive data structures.\r\n\r\nYou can use `GetTypeInfo()` to call `GetONNXType()` to find out what a particular value contains. You then can use other `TypeInfo` methods to retrieve type specific metadata.\r\n\r\nSee [Onnx standard](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/onnx/onnx.proto3) that Onnxruntime aspires to implement.\r\n\r\nSequences may contain any other data type including other sequences, maps and tensors. All of those are presented as OrtValues. \r\n\r\nMaps are composed of two OrtValues. Keys are always represented by a tensor, so keys data types can either be primitive or strings.\r\n\r\nThe number of keys is the same as the number of values and they are in the same order.\r\nThe OrtValue for map values can either contain a tensor with primitive data types or a  sequence of composite types such as other sequences or maps.\r\n\r\n`GetValueCount()` would always return 2 maps (1 for keys and 1 for values).\r\n`GetValueCount()` would return N for the number of ortvalues contained in the sequence.\r\n\r\n`GetValue()` would enable you to retrieve by index  ortvalues contained within composite types.\r\n\r\nAny composite data type eventually reduces to an `OrtValue` that contains a tensor.\r\n",
