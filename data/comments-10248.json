        "body": "I would guess that adding TFLite as an ONNX EP, or creating an EP that implements the TFLite delegate API, would be better choices than talking to libedgetpu itself.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the TFLite delegate is *the* supported method of using the Edge TPU, rather than using libedgetpu directly. Talking to the delegate instead insulates you from changes in the (semi-undocumented, potentially unstable) libedgetpu API.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this would make it possible to use other TFLite delegates in the future, either to introduce support for new hardware that becomes available, or just for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nAs a practical matter though, if the libedgetpu is significantly easier to integrate with, that may be better. TFLite has a complex build system, and the set of ops it supports is determined at build time, etc. Also, converting a model from ONNX to TFLite requires using TensorFlow to do an intermediary conversion; that may require calling out to Python.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome time ago I ran an experiment previously to see which of the ONNX Model Zoo could be converted to TFLite.
