        "body": "Hi, @JasonMaojinsong \r\nI found the same problem when I quantize my model. The range of conv output is very wide, so the scale is very large, e.g. 0.449, so the qdq error is very large because of the large scale factor, which makes the final precision drops a lot.\r\n\r\nI wonder what should we do to avoid the presicion lost when we come across big scale factor?",
