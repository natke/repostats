One needs to look into the source code to see that the error might be in one of the nodes and at least from the python API, there is no hint at where in the code the error was thrown making it very hard to figure out what the problem actually is.

Also, avoid Im2col for pointwise convolutions in ConvInteger.\r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**\r\nMore incremental work to improve model performance when using ConvInteger/QLinearConv. For ConvInteger, all large percentage of time is spent in the im2col transform. This change simplifies Math::Im2col while speeding up the transform. Most of the observed speed gain is from this part of the change.\r\n\r\nThis also implements the standard optimization of not needing to do an im2col for a pointwise convolution as the input tensor is already in the correct format for the GEMM.\r\n\r\nFor a quantized resnet50 based on ConvInteger, the inference time went from 72ms->60ms.\r\n\r\nOne experiment was to handle the stride_w=2 convolutions by using SSE instructions to load 16 bytes, swizzle to 8 bytes, and write that out. That did help a bit but the resnet50 inference time only went down by <1ms, so this was avoided for now. Multi-threading the im2col with the GEMM would also help (as done for MlasConv for float data), but that can now be evaluated against a more reasonable im2col baseline.\r\n\r\nAdded more ConvInteger tests that exercise more code paths, including 3D, pointwise, and various strides. The new im2col was also tested in isolation with a larger range of parameters and compared to the old im2col. I also updated the non-MLAS path for Conv<float> to use the same pattern as ConvInteger and verified that the results were identical for several CNNs.\r\n",

What problem does it solve?\r\n  The current implementation calls Partition() on the same graph when detected the first function body to inline. This may lead to a stack overflow if there are too many nodes that have function body. This change modified the code to stop making self-recursive call and changed it to a while-loop. The feature behavior should be equivalent.\r\n",

However, testing fails in 25% of all tests.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I tried to step through the onnxruntime_providers.cmake and saw that \"PYTHON_LIB\" is empty after \"find_package(InferenceEngine 2.1 REQUIRED)\" is run\r\n\r\nI changed (onnxruntime_providers.cmake, line 333)\r\nfrom\r\n`find_package(InferenceEngine 2.1 REQUIRED)`\r\nto \r\n`set(_PYTHON_LIB ${PYTHON_LIB})`\r\n`  find_package(InferenceEngine 2.1 REQUIRED)`\r\n`set(PYTHON_LIBRARIES ${_PYTHON_LIB})`\r\nwhich fixed the CMake link warning from above. However, this also leads to a bad result.\r\n\r\nI guess some openvino lib is missing, but I can't figure out what to do about that.. \r\nDid this problem occure to someone else, too? Or does anyone know, how to fix it?",

The test model uses each intermediate tensor in the graph as input to the next NCHWc node and also includes the tensor in graph's outputs. The optimizer was not counting the graph output use in this case, so the Finalize pass did not emit ReorderOutput nodes to maintain the link to the graph outputs.\r\n\r\nAdded a test case for this type of graph. Also verified that the customer model runs as expected.",

Converting from NCHWc to NHWC tensors is a trivial copy of data and avoids the cost of a transpose node.\r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**\r\nMany models are converted from NHWC sources and while the model converter can optimize away most transposes, not all can be easily removed. This adds support for one part of the problem: instead of reordering NCHWc to NCHW and then doing a transpose to NHWC, extend the ReorderOutput op to support NHWC directly.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the problem, converting NHWC to NCHWc via ReorderInput nodes, will be handled later.\r\n\r\nAs an example, tinyyolov3 from the model zoo goes from 22.7ms->22.4ms per inference.",

This change eliminates redundant computation.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, this optimization could be applied on case-by-case basis in the original source code (e.g. PyTorch). However, existence of redundant computation may be non-obvious; also, if part of the source code is third-party, it complicates things even more.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is quite basic and could be improved in future. For example, we could merge identical constant initializers or apply global value numbering (working across subgraphs).",

For some reason this runs _only on my CPU_ with a very small spike in volatile GPU memory.\r\n\r\nWhen I use the python API for onnxruntime-gpu the model runs as expected for v1.1.1.\r\n \r\nThere must be a build issue that does not build GPU support for Op Set 11. \r\n \r\n**Urgency**\r\nUnable to run BERT and other models with Op Set 11 on [TensorRT Inference Server](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorrt-inference-server).\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- Linux Ubuntu 18.04:\r\n- ONNX Runtime built from source\r\n- ONNX Runtime version: 1.1.1\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0\r\n- GPU model and memory: TITAN V 12GB\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nBuild using the following command:\r\n```\r\nARG COMMON_BUILD_ARGS=\"--skip_submodule_sync --parallel --build_shared_lib --use_openmp\"\r\nRUN mkdir -p /workspace/build\r\nRUN python3 /workspace/onnxruntime/tools/ci_build/build.py --build_dir /workspace/build \\\r\n            --config Release $COMMON_BUILD_ARGS \\\r\n            --use_cuda \\\r\n            --cuda_home /usr/local/cuda \\\r\n            --cudnn_home /usr/local/cudnn-$(echo $CUDNN_VERSION | cut -d. -f1-2)/cuda \\\r\n            --use_tensorrt \\\r\n            --tensorrt_home /usr/src/tensorrt \\\r\n            --use_openvino CPU_FP32 \\\r\n            --update \\\r\n            --build\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoad and run any model with Op Set 11\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n[This](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/docs/Versioning.md\r\n) shows that onnxruntime 1.1.0 onward should support Opset 11. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nExperienced with BERT \r\n",

This PR ensures again that onnxruntime won't link against windowsapp.lib unless the wcos scenario is specifically requested. All our pipelines for now will continue not enabling wcos. The work to remove winrt from winml_adapter was necessary to get onnxruntime to build with the adapter but without linking against windowsapp.lib.\r\n",

        "body": "Hi,\r\nI am using the python api with cpu version to inference. But somethings confuse me. If I start only one process, the inference speed is very fast. However, if I start 2 or more processes, all processes inference very slowly, even stuck. I got the clue in the file \"onnxruntime/core/util/thread_utils.cc\", so I let inter_op_num_threads=2 and intra_op_num_threads=2, and export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1. \r\n\r\nFrom \"onnxruntime/core/util/thread_utils.cc\", it seems that the each onnxruntime process use at least 2 threads (when setting inter_op_num_threads=1, the programme use half of cores automatically), thus it causes the competition.\r\n\r\nAfter setting inter_op_num_threads, intra_op_num_threads and OMP_NUM_THREADS, all processes could work well, at least they do not stuck. But the inference speed still become slower, compared with single process. So, I use the command \"top -Hp sid\" to check the process, I found that the process still opens multi threads. What should I do to make it possible to start multi processes without inference speed loss.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n \r\n![TIM截图20200227180632](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10486524/75434041-e6756180-598b-11ea-8ed3-c4a9813addc7.png)\r\n",

The EP-specific native shared library artifacts will be part of separate EP-specific nugets (eg: Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime for CPU and Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime .Gpu for GPU). The \"native\" nuget will depend on the \"managed\" nuget so as to bring it into relevant projects automatically.\r\n\r\nResolve #2184",

Name:'ReorderInput_217' Status Message: /onnxruntime_src/onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cpu/nchwc_ops.cc:76 onnxruntime::common::Status onnxruntime::contrib::ReorderInput<T>::Compute(onnxruntime::OpKernelContext*) const [with T = float] (X_shape[1] % MlasNchwcGetBlockSize()) == 0 was false. \r\n\r\nCan you help me debug this issue? I have tried converting similar models straight from the tensorflow OD API model zoo, and this error doesn't occur (I froze the models using the same version of tensorflow 1.14 and using the same version of OD API).\r\n\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): binary\r\n- ONNX Runtime version: 1.1.12\r\n- Python version: 3.6.9\r\n- CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1 \r\n- GPU model and memory: GeForce 940MX / 4GB\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter successfully converting the model to .onnx without any errors, the onnxruntime throws the aforementioned error. I expected that onnxruntime will run the converted model without any problems.\r\n",
