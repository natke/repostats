We don't have FP16 impl for CPU kernel, but for CUDA, I think all the float types are supported, not sure why it still hits the error. @dashesy , could you please share a sample onnx file that can reproduce this issue? Or share the data types of all the inputs to the SimplifiedLayerNormalization node (if you have the optimized graph)?",
