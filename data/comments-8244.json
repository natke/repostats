        "body": "Inferencing on multiple GPUs can be done in one of 3 ways - pipeline parallelism (where the model is split offline into multiple models and each model is inferenced on a separate GPU in a pipelined fashion to maximize GPU utilization) or tensor/model parallelism (where the computation of a model is split among multiple GPUs) or a combination of both when multiple machines are involved. \r\n\r\nPipeline parallelism is easier to achieve. We've experimental (not released yet, but functional) code to do this for GPT-style models and are in the process of refining it. For simple pipeline parallelism use cases (non-GPT), you can use (for e.g.) Intel TBB's parallel_pipeline or flow graph constructs to create a pipeline of multiple partitions of the model where each partition is associated with its own ORT session created on a its own and separate GPU device id. This can be completely accomplished outside ORT's codebase using ORT's public APIs. If you've any more questions, feel free to reach out to me and I can point you to the experimental code we've.

In order to do so the model needs to be modified in-memory in a way that allows scatter/gather of computation across multiple GPUs. This is typically done by introducing nodes that do this scatter/gather. This is something we're currently experimenting with.\r\n\r\n",

You can do inferencing in the same thread, just not concurrently. So, in the same thread you can create 2 separate sessions (tied to separate GPU device ids) and inference them one after another. Does this not work for you? To ensure the correct GPU is used, you may call SetCurrentGpuDeviceId before calling Run() to set the device for the calling host thread.",

        "body": "> Inferencing on multiple GPUs can be done in one of 3 ways - pipeline parallelism (where the model is split offline into multiple models and each model is inferenced on a separate GPU in a pipelined fashion to maximize GPU utilization) or tensor/model parallelism (where the computation of a model is split among multiple GPUs) or a combination of both when multiple machines are involved.\r\n> \r\n> Pipeline parallelism is easier to achieve. We've experimental (not released yet, but functional) code to do this for GPT-style models and are in the process of refining it. For simple pipeline parallelism use cases (non-GPT), you can use (for e.g.) Intel TBB's parallel_pipeline or flow graph constructs to create a pipeline of multiple partitions of the model where each partition is associated with its own ORT session created on a its own and separate GPU device id. This can be completely accomplished outside ORT's codebase using ORT's public APIs. If you've any more questions, feel free to reach out to me and I can point you to the experimental code we've. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nThanks a lot for your comprehensive answer.\r\nYou have proposed a solution for how we can deploy models on multiple GPUs. The way you proposed means to divide the PyTorch model into multiple parts and convert each part to ONNX and then for each ONNX part of the model, we should create a specific ORT session? This is the thing you mean?\r\nIf what I undestand was correct, do you have any fast solution on how we can align the outputs of each part of the model to each other so that the total model can work perfectly?
