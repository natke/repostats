        "body": "Just want to clarify in addition to what velickov said:\r\n\r\nThe name of the parameter and the docs are slightly different:\r\n- do_copy_in_default_stream\r\n- Flag indicating if copying needs to take place on the same stream as the compute stream in the CUDA EP\r\n\r\nThe \"do_copy_in_default_stream\" flag was added as part of fix for https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/4829.\r\nAt that time, the name of the parameter and the docs were both correct.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit (which happened after the previous fix), it is not true anymore that the copy and compute will happen in default stream: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/commit/299ace0759192557e97e14d03c08f0334c84e9d5\r\n\r\n**So at the moment, the name do_copy_in_default_stream is misleading** (even though the docs are correct). We've faced issues very similar to the ones in the 4829 issue, and culprit was that we were doing something in the default stream prior to running inference, without setting user_compute_stream stream parameter to the default stream. This led to a race condition bug, which took us a lot of time to find. Once we saw that something was being processed out of the default stream, we managed to find the solution for this (by setting has_user_compute_stream and user_compute_stream to non default values, which point to the default stream).\r\n\r\nI guess this can be fixed either by:\r\n- Changing the name of the parameter\r\n- Updating the docs to better clarify that this name is misleading, and explaining what does this parameter do in combination with has_user_compute_stream and user_compute_stream\r\n- Change the functionality that this parameter controls so that it does what it's name suggests.\r\n\r\nI'd vote for the first + the second one.",
