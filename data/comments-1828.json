        "body": "@motikad Seems we have a real model now finally that hits this. Want to reopen the issue? It's interesting to hear that OpenVINO also supports axes along with the DML EP, because typically the CPU provider is more complete and compliant to the ONNX spec than the secondary EP's. Being unfamiliar with the code, I made the minimal change last year to at least warn the user of incorrect results, but hopefully someone on ORT who is familiar with Eigen can update this. üëç",
