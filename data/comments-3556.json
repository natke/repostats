Previously, I had always used the constructor that takes a string path to the model file on disk.  But since a handy constructor exists using a data buffer, one can stream the (encrypted) file in, then unencrypt the buffer, then hand the buffer to the Session constructor.  This way, the model file written on disk (and subject to theft) is always an encrypted file.  Hope that helps.  If so, you owe me one!",

You might need other functions from the `save_model` when you have some special onnx models.\r\nFor me the `onnx.save_model` did nothing but:\r\n```\r\n// proto = keras2onnx.convert_keras(...) //create onnx model\r\n// keras2onnx.save_model(proto, filePath) // replaced by the next three lanes\r\npString = proto.SerializeToString()\r\nfrom typing import cast, Text\r\nwith open(cast(Text, filePath), \"wb\") as writable:\r\n    writable.write(pString)\r\n```\r\nSo I replaced the last three lines with\r\n```        \r\nfIn = io.BytesIO(pString)\r\nwith open(onnxPath.with_suffix(\".onnx_enc8\"), \"wb\") as fOut:\r\n    pyAesCrypt.encryptStream(fIn, fOut, password, bufferSize)\r\n```\r\nHow to encrypt and decrypt with pyAesCrypt is explained here: https://github.com/marcobellaccini/pyAesCrypt\r\n\r\nSo overall replace `keras2onnx.save_model(proto, filePath)` with:\r\n```\r\nimport pyAesCrypt\r\nbufferSize = 64 * 1024\r\npassword = \"adobe123\"\r\npString = proto.SerializeToString()\r\nfIn = io.BytesIO(pString)\r\nwith open(onnxPath.with_suffix(\".onnx_enc8\"), \"wb\") as fOut:\r\n    pyAesCrypt.encryptStream(fIn, fOut, password, bufferSize)\r\n```",

Welcome to contribute.\r\n\r\nHi @snnn \r\nI know the ticket is closed but the question for onnxrt to support encrypted models is still open.\r\nEncrypting the onnx file could be done offline using whatever framework used for training.\r\nWhat is missing is an option/addon for onnxrt to decrypt it using a given key.\r\nI know it s possible to manually do it by first decrypting in ram and then loading the onnx Session from a mem buffer.\r\nBut this is adding an extra layer that would also have to be protected against hacking and that could be done by onnxrt internally.\r\nIt would just need :\r\n- a AES decryt implementation : that could be provided by any header only lib as plusaes (see ref).\r\n- a new onnxrt Sessions load API method taking an extra param for the key\r\n\r\nAny cons/would you accept a PR ?\r\nKind\r\nWT.\r\nRefs:\r\nhttps://github.com/kkAyataka/plusaes\r\nhttps://medium.com/@ovechko.056/tensorflow-pretrained-model-encryption-decryption-in-mobile-apps-e3e95209716a\r\n",

        "body": "I feel people often get confused by two concepts: encryption and obfuscation. I feel what you want is obfuscation, which is for making reverse engineering difficult. And AES doesn't do any help on that.  For example, if you have a OAUTH2 API key and you want to keep it private to your application, you need to obfuscation your application so that people like me can't put a debugger on it.  There are a lot of commercial SDKs(e.g. VMProtect) to help this, and it is far beyond of onnxruntime's scope. \r\n\r\nWhat onnxruntime would do is adding confidential computing support.
