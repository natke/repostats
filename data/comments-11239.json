I tried to use [RNFS](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs), in particular `RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath`, but I couldn't find my onnx model file under all sub-directories of `RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath`, which evaluates to `/data/user/0/com.onnxtestbed/files`. Do you by chance know what I did wrong here or have any suggestions on other ways to accomplish the same thing as expo? Thanks!\r\n",

        "body": "> There is other solution. For that one, I just did a const MODEL_URL = require('./modelfile.file_extention'); to load the model file. This solution is not related to this onnx solution. I see they just use some setting to allow the RN to load the model. Remeber the ONNX RN doc said you can't load it as the javascript? But that solution \"may\" not be stable because I feel it is stable after a few improvment. I applied that solution for my project in NLP question and answering for a start up by that solution. You can see the working solution in my youtube channel.\r\n> \r\n> But what if we can apply that to ONNX...does it mean we can do it? I think you can see what it is. But it may not work for your case because I don't even know what model you are trying to use.\r\n\r\nThanks for you insight and suggestions! And after `const MODEL_URL = require('./modelfile.file_extention');`, do you simply do `const session: ort.InferenceSession = await ort.InferenceSession.create(MODEL_URL);`? My model is nothing fancy, it's literally a linear blend operation (see picture below) and has no weights at all. You can also find the `.ort` model in the link to the repo above if you want to give it a try. Also just to make sure we are on the same page, are you using plain react native and not expo and testing it on physical Android phone? Thanks for the help again!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28615340/172275218-9d94abf7-955d-4d24-bbf4-ef9c2d3f2f4a.png)\r\n",

I am using metro and did see a number returned by `require()` like you said. However, I couldn't find helper methods from metro to extract the full file path given an asset ID number. On the other hand, earlier I thought `Image.resolveAssetSource()` can only be used with image asset, but it looks like I can use it to get the link to my `ort` model file as well; in other words, `Image.resolveAssetSource()` works with non-image assets as well, is my understanding correct?\r\n\r\nI also tried the approach you suggested and downloaded the model file onto the temporary folder using `RNFS`. And even though I can see the model file in the temporary directory when I print out all the content of the temporary directory, the model loading still failed when I passed in the file path of the downloaded model file in the temporary directory. The error message is `Error Message: [Error: Can't load a model: No content provider: /data/user/0/com.onnxtestbed/cache/LinearBlend_v001.ort]`. I am running my bare react-native project (no expo) using android studio and testing it on my physical android device. You can find the code to reproduce the error here [https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-issue](https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-issue) (I also realized that in my very original post on the very top, the link to the repo is broken but they are fixed now).\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if you could please let me know what I did wrong in my code, and thank you so much for your help again!",

It is caused by the native module is not loaded as expected. This is usually caused by not setting up `onnxruntime-react-native` correctly in the ios/Podfile.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your insight! I am using the automatically generated `ios` project folder inside the bare React Native project generated using the command `npx react-native init MyProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript`. I also inspected the pod file and made sure to do `npx pod-install` before I build and run the project, but the error still persists. You can follow the following steps to reproduce the issue, I would really appreciate it if you have any more insights or could spot any mistakes during my setup:\r\n\r\n1. Clone project code from the [ort-react-native-issue](https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-issue) repo (it's the same repo and code linked above earlier, but with the `file://` fix added and I have confirmed that it now works with Android)\r\n2. `cd` into the `ONNXTestbed` folder\r\n3. Execute the `npm install` command\r\n4. Execute the `npm pod-install` command\r\n5. `cd` into the `ios` folder\r\n6. Execute the `npx react-native start` command\r\n7. Open the `ONNXTestbed.xcworkspace` file inside the `ios` folder using Xcode and run the project\r\n8. Click \"Start Inference\" on the top of the screen after the app is loaded\r\n\r\nYou should then be able to see the content of the temporary folder (including the model that has just been downloaded into the temporary directory) as well as the error message in the terminal.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help and time again! I really appreciate it.",
