        "body": "@hanbitmyths Ah, I see, thank you. It would be helpful for newbies like me if the error message mentioned the data type - can I submit a pull request for this?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a tool in the onnx ecosystem to do this conversion? I've been hacking on two scripts ([float16-to-float32](https://github.com/josephrocca/onnx-typecast/blob/master/convert-float16-to-float32.py) and [int64-to-int32](https://github.com/josephrocca/onnx-typecast/blob/master/convert-int64-to-int32.py)), but they're very haphazard and even after fixing the above bug ([here's the new model file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1deH8a8ZpYTyNTK0uNgSAbuFW23FTSUKy/view?usp=sharing)) I've ran into `Type Error: Type parameter (T) of Optype (Div) bound to different types (tensor(int64) and tensor(int32) in node (Div_27).` Netron says that the axis value of the `Gather_25` op that feeds into that `Div` is `int64`, but reading the onnx profobuf, it just says \"INT\": `attribute { name: \"axis\", i: 0, type: INT }`, and the `AttributeProto.INT32` type doesn't exist. I wouldn't have thought that the axis attribute would affect the output type in any case.\r\n\r\nHere's a video of netron showing the data for the relevant nodes (the axis attribute of Gather is the only int64 datatype, but as previously mentioned the protobuf just says `INT`):\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1167575/141797879-abb32e85-9729-4d3b-8869-2c5158e4abcd.mp4",

At the logging level of INFO/VERBOSE, you should find such logging messages about ops that are supported but just missing type support. The default logging level is WARNING. By default, only logs of the level >= WARNING are printed.\r\n\r\nI **think** the reason why this can't be made a WARNING/ERROR level log is because this is printed while searching within one kernel registry. At this point, we have no way of knowing if there is a kernel that supports this type in another kernel registry and an WARNING/ERROR log could be mis-leading if that was the case. Anyway, I will leave it to the original implementer of this logging functionality (@pranavsharma) to see if he has a way to print out such useful logging messages at the default logging level. \r\n\r\n",

You might have better luck.\r\n\r\nI think I do the same thing that I convert clip text model to onnx and auccur the same error. \r\nI also unfortunately run into more int64 related problems,\r\nso did you solve the all problem about clip's text model ?\r\n\r\nhow can we get around this problem?\r\n\r\nI try to use clip's onnx model to deploy, and you?",
