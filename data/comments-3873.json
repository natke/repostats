Yet the exported ONNX model has this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9969784/97056265-6bc20d80-153d-11eb-8605-8c12da62fc41.png)\r\n\r\nBoth mean and variance are off compared to the manually computed values.\r\n\r\nWhen I override the model's mean and var with my manually computed mean and var (above), the manually computed results (and ORT’s results) align with Torch’s results exactly. So, we need to understand the exporter’s rationale for the mean and variance it has stamped to this node. \r\n",

For the parameters provided in the exported ONNX model, ORT seems to crunch the numbers correctly (i.e.) there doesn’t seem to be any bug in ORT that is causing the data mismatch. As to why Torch’s internal parameters are different while inferencing its model from the exported ONNX model’s parameters, it is beyond my scope of knowledge. Sorry.\r\n\r\n",
