Adding (pre)-padding nodes also removes the warning but only brings a speedup of ~3.  ",

        "body": "Just to share my experience though. the yolov3 model in onnx model zoo if one of the reimplementation of the original yolov3, which has , more or less difference compared to the original. I have tried other yolov3 onnx from different source codes, and the performance was OK. So for those who tried to look for a way to deploy yolov3 onnx in C++, if the perf problem still persists with the latest onnxruntime version, maybe you can try another open-source implementation of yolov3.",
