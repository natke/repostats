If both give the same results (and they are incorrect when compared with tf), then most likely the issue is either tf to onnx conversion or pre-processing.\r\n\r\n2) Check the pre-processing being applied before feeding the input. The pre-processing needs to be exactly what was applied to the input images while training the model. Please ensure that you are able to verify this with high confidence.\r\n",
