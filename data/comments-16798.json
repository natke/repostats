        "body": "@fs-eire Sorry for the delayed reply. Can confirm that for the Chrome test, at least, it's using `dist/ort-wasm-simd.wasm`. Not sure how to test on the others. But since all 3 of them are using the same engine (V8), this would seem to indicate that we might be able to get a 2x speedup in browsers (!!) if we can work out what's going on when it's running in the Node.js runtime?\r\n\r\nI thought maybe Node.js was ignoring the `wasm.numThreads` option, but that's not the case according to `htop` - just a single thread is spiking during computation.\r\n\r\nRE your second point, the `node_modules/onnruntime-web/dist` folder does contain `ort-web.node.js` which IIUC is different to `onnxruntime-web@1.15.1/dist/ort.js`, but I'm guessing this is just because Node.js workers need to be spawned in a different way, and stuff like that - i.e. it's still using V8 (rather than doing FFI stuff to get speed boosts over what V8 can achieve).",
