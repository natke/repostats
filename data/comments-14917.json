It has been deprecated in the most recent release due to a low value and exception safety issues. Instead, the public API has been refactored and it now includes API that is to be used within Custom Ops. The code has been refactored as well. You can just take a look at the most recent version of the header.\r\n\r\nC API stays the same for now, but will change to accommodate various requirements.",
