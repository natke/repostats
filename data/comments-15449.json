        "body": "Releasing version 1.14.1 would be greatly appreciated!\r\nAs a developer of multi-platform applications for both PC and mobile devices, onnxruntime plays an active role in these projects. However, the lack of a specific version for Android makes maintaining the applications a bit inconvenient.\r\nWhile understanding that releasing a new version might be cumbersome, there is [an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/14950) that mentions the lack of an automated release process. Improving and automating this process would be extremely helpful, and it would be wonderful if version 1.14.1 for Java could be released.",
