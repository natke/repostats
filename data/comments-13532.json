However, I test Megatron with DeepSpeed ZeRO1 in which case I think compatible with onnx training because the official experiment also used ZeRO1.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15059072/199380415-d7f5132a-1297-4278-95f0-4e48ec10a9fc.png)\r\nMoreover, I also test Megatron without DeepSpeed and I see no enhancement of training speed.",
