        "body": "You need to build a model with only one operator doing what you need to do. One way to do it is:\r\n\r\n* write the code you want to execute with torch\r\n* export it as a model\r\n* use onnxruntime to execute it\r\n\r\nThese steps are very similar to what a jit does. If you need a couple of functionalities, you may use onnx directly to create your own graphs: https://onnx.ai/onnx/intro/python.html. If you need something more automated and you don't want to implement everything, onnxscript or spox should make your life easier.",
