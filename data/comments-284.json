        "body": "@MironAtHome Let's make it clear, you are attempting to run protoc on files that reside in paths that have UNICODE characters within them. Was protobuf code written in a way that it can handle UNICODE characters? Addining `_DUNICODE` switches to the command line is not enough.\r\n`-DUNICODE` is a Microsoft specific switch which may affect lots of stuff , but then again, affect nothing depending on the way code is written.\r\n\r\nI took a brief look at protobuf code on GitHub and it looks like it is written in a way that it supports Unicode paths regardless of `-DUNICODE` presence at least here:\r\nhttps://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/io/io_win32.cc#L317\r\n\r\nBut it requires that the rest of the code treats path strings as UTF-8 encoding, otherwise it will attempt to convert to a codepage CP_ACP in this case, this is almost never what you want.  You will notice that \r\nhttps://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/io/io_win32.cc#L383\r\ntakes a flag `bool inUtf8` that denotes the string conversion from multibyte to widechar which is UTF-16 on Windows.\r\n\r\nBottom line, if you are able to build protobuf outside onnxruntime in  way that it handles UNICODE paths, we will make sure it does the same within onnxruntime.",
