This has the additional benefit of not requiring or installing (which build.py automatically does in some cases) onnxruntime dependencies in your system Python installation. I didn't see this error when using a virtual environment on Ubuntu 20.04.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to manually set PYTHON_LIBRARY and PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR (more info at https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPythonLibs.html). You can give an additional argument to build.sh: `--cmake_extra_defines PYTHON_LIBRARY=... PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=...`, see an example here: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/5cf66069645d338b481e70dcfe869161c03e102f/tools/ci_build/github/azure-pipelines/linux-gpu-ci-pipeline.yml#L42\r\n\r\nAnd just to note, the `--build_wheel` option implies `--enable_pybind`.",
