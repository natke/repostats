        "body": "We have encountered this issue in general feature engineering contexts many times. We work primarily with tabular data and would like our ONNX models to mirror our existing pandas-based pipelines as closely as possible. Pandas pretty much always defaults to `double`, though, which made us run into this issue here. Not having `Split` is very limiting in this regard. The missing `double`-implementation for `IsNaN` can be worked around with `Not` and `Equal`, but that is still an unfortunate paper cut.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have these included in `onnxruntime` in the future.",
