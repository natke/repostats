From the error message, it seems you have the wrong format of provider option 'trt_profile_min_shapes'. Also, you can turn on verbose logging to see the whole log including the provider options as well as the parsing of the profile string.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the example I tested for these explicit profiles using onnxruntime_perf_test:\r\n(Note: you need to set those three provider options, `\"trt_profile_min_shapes|imgs:1x3x384x288 trt_profile_max_shapes|imgs:32x3x384x288 trt_profile_opt_shapes|imgs:32x3x384x288\"`)\r\n```\r\n./build/Linux/Release/./onnxruntime_perf_test -e tensorrt -r 100 -i \"trt_profile_min_shapes|imgs:1x3x384x288 trt_profile_max_shapes|imgs:32x3x384x288 trt_profile_opt_shapes|imgs:32x3x384x288\" ~/test.onnx\r\n```\r\n```\r\n....\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249626764 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:386 MakeInputNameShapePair] [TensorRT EP] imgs:1x3x384x288\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249665939 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:445 ParseProfileShapes] [TensorRT EP] imgs\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249676018 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:451 ParseProfileShapes] [TensorRT EP] 1, 3, 384, 288,\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249685025 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:386 MakeInputNameShapePair] [TensorRT EP] imgs:32x3x384x288\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249692519 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:445 ParseProfileShapes] [TensorRT EP] imgs\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249700665 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:451 ParseProfileShapes] [TensorRT EP] 32, 3, 384, 288,\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249706606 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:386 MakeInputNameShapePair] [TensorRT EP] imgs:32x3x384x288\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249715483 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:445 ParseProfileShapes] [TensorRT EP] imgs\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249723679 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider_utils.h:451 ParseProfileShapes] [TensorRT EP] 32, 3, 384, 288,\r\n2023-04-21 17:59:14.249732706 [V:onnxruntime:Default, tensorrt_execution_provider.cc:908 TensorrtExecutionProvider] [TensorRT EP] TensorRT provider options: device_id: 0, trt_max_partition_iterations: 1000, trt_min_subgraph_size: 1, trt_max_workspace_size: 1073741824, trt_fp16_enable: 0, trt_int8_enable: 0, trt_int8_calibration_cache_name: , int8_calibration_cache_available: 0, trt_int8_use_native_tensorrt_calibration_table: 0, trt_dla_enable: 0, trt_dla_core: 0, trt_dump_subgraphs: 0, trt_engine_cache_enable: 0, trt_cache_path: , trt_engine_decryption_enable: 0, trt_engine_decryption_lib_path: , trt_force_sequential_engine_build: 0, trt_context_memory_sharing_enable: 0, trt_layer_norm_fp32_fallback: 0, trt_build_heuristics_enable: 0, trt_sparsity_enable: 0, trt_builder_optimization_level: 2, trt_auxiliary_streams: -1, trt_tactic_sources: , trt_profile_min_shapes: imgs:1x3x384x288, trt_profile_max_shapes: imgs:32x3x384x288, trt_profile_opt_shapes: imgs:32x3x384x288\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRe:  Apart from that I am concerned about (1) Whole graph can be run on TRT. I think this means that a graph with an Onnx NonMaxSupression node will not work. \r\n\r\nThis PR actually supports the \"graph can be partially run on TRT\", could you also try it with your model?\r\nThe reason we impose this restriction of \"Whole graph can be run on TRT\" is to simplify the user scenario of using explicit profiles. We are open to any suggestions, so we do appreciate your feedback after testing it. Thank you!",

Once the engine cache is being used for another deployment environment, this PR asks user to add additional provider option `trt_engine_cache_built_with_explicit_profiles` (However, no need to add those explicit profiles provider option) in order to use the engine built with explicit profiles. Otherwise, TRT EP will fallback to original logic of determining the min/max/opt profiles for you and rebuilds the engine if needed.\r\n\r\nDo you think this usage easy to use? Really appreciate you feedback!\r\n\r\n[UPDATE 4/26] After internal discussion, we decided not to add `trt_engine_cache_built_with_explicit_profiles`. User needs to provide those three explict profiles regardless of engine cache enable.",
