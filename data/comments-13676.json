The workaround I used to unblock our dev teams was https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/onnxruntime/commit/53c24ad7d3469511b9d742ca97d024c569a854e5.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI think the correct solution is to update the abseil-cpp submodule, as suggested above.  I didn't submit a PR to do that because I wasn't sure if there would be any unintended consequences.  I didn't see a release version of abseil-cpp available at its project page that contained the fix; the fix only appeared to be in the development branch.  I don't know abseil-cpp well enough to know whether it's development branch is considered stable, or if you need to wait for the next stable release package to be available.",
