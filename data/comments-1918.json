        "body": "> 1. dim1 = -1 creates a problem; I think that -1 corresponds to None in python and it is used for batch size; but to make the program runs I had to add a workaround and changed dim1 to 1 as follows:\r\n\r\nThe dimension value in the model and the input are two different things.\r\n\r\nIn the model a symbolic dimension (e.g. the batch size dimension) will not have a concrete value. It could have a name, or nothing other than an empty entry to indicate the rank. The actual value is not known until an inference is run and the input for that inference is received.\r\n\r\nWhen you're creating input to run the model however that input does have a concrete value (as you have the actual input data with a known size) for the dimension, so using -1 is not valid. \r\n\r\nAre the dimension values for the actual input created in python the same as in C++?",
