I make simplification packages for end user tools so the debugging portion isn't something that my end users should need to worry about. They build the tool and use it. If or when they find a bug I fix it and re-ship the package. I would like them to be able to build from a package that could be around a 5fith of the size, \r\n\r\nI appreciate that other users have different needs. So I suggested the symbol packages even though my research suggests they may be a bit cumbersome to use.\r\n\r\n@nietras, What overhead do you encounter?",

        "body": "Happy new year to you too @yanyas \r\n\r\nI definitely understand and think disk footprint is important, but I do not think the pdb files are the main culprit here. Having pdb files available in a symbol server is an option, but often this becomes a problem, if the server is not available for eternity. \r\n\r\nThe main problem is how OnnxRuntime employs a \"one size fits all\" approach to nuget packaging. Made worse by there being \"one big\" nuget package for different execution providers. This means class library use of OnnxRuntime is problematic since you have to deal with this then defining the execution provider for any users of the class library.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion the packaging and project structure needs to be overhauled to be modular and pluggable, this would match the true scope and benefit of the runtime. Below I try to give an example of how OnnxRuntime could be packaged as a small underlying set of packages that can then be references from meta-packages if need be. Each execution provider should have it's own set of packages. \r\n\r\nPrefix below with `Microsoft.ML.` to match current naming. The structuring below is for C# mainly, but same principles can be applied to C/C++ users.\r\n```\r\nOnnxRuntime.Interop (basic and general interface for OnnxRuntime from C#, does not refer to any runtimes or similar)\r\nOnnxRuntime.runtimes.win-x64 (native dlls only, onnxruntime.dll)\r\nOnnxRuntime.runtimes.linux-x64 \r\nOnnxRuntime.runtimes.macOS-x64\r\nOnnxRuntime.MKLML.Interop (this defines an extension method to allow adding the execution provider from C#)\r\nOnnxRuntime.MKLML.runtimes.win-x64 (native dlls only, onnxruntime-mklml.dll and mklml.dll etc.)\r\nOnnxRuntime.MKLML.runtimes.linux-x64\r\nOnnxRuntime.MKLML.runtimes.macOS-x64\r\n```\r\nNaming is just examples :) You can replace `MKLML` with whatever execution provider there is e.g. `CUDA`, `TensorRT` etc. You can pick and chose which runtime you want by picking packages. You can have class libraries refer to just `OnnxRuntime.Interop` and in the final \"composition root\" e.g. application you can then add whatever execution runtimes you want for whatever platforms you need. This would both reduce disk footprint a lot for our use case, but also allow for publishing of all supported execution providers without making a huge one size fits all package and not the least avoid the \"build from source\" solution there is right now for any execution providers not available as nuget packages.\r\n\r\nYou can still have a single meta-package `OnnxRuntime` that encompasses the default components for ease of use, but this allows any real world use to be much more flexible.\r\n\r\nIf there is any interest in this I might make a more formal issue proposing the restructuring to give us the above.\r\n\r\n@snnn ",

In the upcoming 1.2 release (early March), we plan on separating the managed assembly into a separate package called Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed. Each execution provider will be delivered in it's own separate package *without* the managed assembly. This aligns with your proposal partially. \r\n\r\nAt this time we do not plan to separate the pdb files and x86/linux/mac binaries into separate packages for the sake of simplicity of our first party users.\r\n\r\nxref: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/2184",
