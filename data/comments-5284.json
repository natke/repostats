Put onnxruntime.dll in the same dir of your main exe when possible \r\n2. Alternatively, in the cases that onnxruntime.dll is dynamically loaded by LoadLibrary function call(like dotnet/python/java applications), please make sure you always use  LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH flag. For example, if you main.exe loads main.dll, then main.dll loads onnxruntime.dll. By default main.dll will try to locate onnxruntime.dll in C:\\windows\\system32 unless main.dll was loaded with \"LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH\".  For example, [this](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Python/dynload_win.c#L219)  is how python handle it. This is a legacy solution, but it is the most commonly known one. \r\n\r\nSorry I don't know much about dotnet.  Years ago all the DLLs were loaded with LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH.  I don't know the current status. \r\n",
