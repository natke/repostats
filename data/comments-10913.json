        "body": "Oh, but now I see that a new problem arises. If we do a bare module import like this:\r\n```js\r\nimport \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/onnxruntime-web@1.10.0/dist/ort.js\";\r\n```\r\nthen `ort.js` isn't able to find the wasm file because `document.currentScript.src` doesn't exist in modules (and `ort.js` is treated like a module in this case). So, to fix this, all references to `document.currentScript.src` should try to fall back to `import.meta.url`.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of some code in `ort.js` trying to detect where it's running, but I think this code is actually generated by webpack? (I haven't used webpack before)\r\n```js\r\nvar _scriptDir = typeof document !== 'undefined' && document.currentScript ? document.currentScript.src : undefined;\r\n```\r\nYou can see other examples by searching [onnxruntime-web@1.10.0/dist/ort.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/onnxruntime-web@1.10.0/dist/ort.js) for \"currentScript\" using `Ctrl+F`.\r\n\r\nI was only able to find [one reference to `document.currentScript.src`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/91722e2bc4ef63add6d548f2b1212a7fd0b10531/js/web/lib/wasm/proxy-wrapper.ts#L82) within the ONNX Runtime Web codebase itself.\r\n\r\n@hanbitmyths, @fs-eire Wondering if you could provide guidance on if/how I can submit a pull request to fall back to `import.meta.url` when `ort.js` is trying to determine its own location? Specifically in regard to how this `_scriptDir` stuff is generated by the bundler. This would allow the library to work in [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and with a \"bare\" ES6 `import` statement in the browser.\r\n\r\nNote that currently it falls back to `__filename` which has a default hard-coded value of `/index.js`, which causes `ort.js` to try to load the wasm file from `/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm`. So, if it's possible ([?](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/)) to change the default `__filename` to a runtime-generated value, then a quick solution might be to set it to `import.meta.url` by default.",
