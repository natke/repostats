        "body": "Hi @rahulnainwal107,\r\n\r\nRegarding loading a local image in react-native application,  I've used ImagePicker in my Expo react native application: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker/#usage\r\n\r\nHere's some sample code snippet:\r\n```\r\nexport default function AndroidApp({ navigation, route }: MainScreenProps) {\r\n  const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState<any>(null);\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function openImagePickerAsync() {\r\n\r\n    const permissionResult = await ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync();\r\n\r\n    if (permissionResult.granted === false) {\r\n      alert(\"Permission to access Camera Roll is Required!\");\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const pickerResult = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({ allowsEditing: true, base64: true });\r\n\r\n    if (pickerResult.cancelled === true) {\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setSelectedImage({\r\n      localUri: pickerResult.uri\r\n    });\r\n \r\n };\r\n\r\n </View>\r\n      {\r\n        selectedImage !== null &&\r\n        <ScrollView style={styles.scrollView}>\r\n          <Image\r\n            source={{ uri: selectedImage.localUri }}\r\n            style={styles.thumbnail}\r\n          />\r\n          {\r\n        </ScrollView>}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is based on steps:\r\n\r\n- Upload local image to android emulator gallery https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29588124/how-to-add-an-image-to-the-emulator-gallery-in-android-studio or have the image ready in photos folder in your android phone\r\n- Once you have the local image ready, imagepicker will select the picture in and  then set it to the selected image uri in Image component source\r\n- In the first ImagePicker api link, it uses a simplier way to load image directly from assets folder. can also take a look.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding your previous question on how to make the image into ort tensor:\r\n- Currently, you will need to enable passing a base64 encoded image string when passing in the jpg/png image from the app.\r\n  If you are using ImagePicker: there's a base64 option allow you to do that: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker/#imagepickerasset \r\n- Once you have the base64 string, use the below sample code to turn it into bytearray and wrap it to an ort tensor:\r\n```\r\nimport { btoa, atob } from 'react-native-quick-base64';\r\n\r\nlet inputDataArray = base64js.toByteArray(base64ImageStringFromUpload)\r\nlet dataLength = inputDataArray.length  \r\nlet tensor = new ort.Tensor(inputDataArray, [dataLength])\r\n```\r\nNote that it uses a base64js npm library : https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-quick-base64 found more information here.\r\nAlso the sample code uses uint8 data type and tensor shape may also needs to get updated according to your model. Would you share which model you will be using? And all code snippets are just for android side as an example. \r\n\r\nPlus, we are working on a sample react-native expo cross platform application with super resolution model, once that sample is ready, would provide more details on how to run an react-native application end-to-end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
