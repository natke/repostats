        "body": "> but it is slower than CPU :( on my system\r\n\r\n@mans0987: For both the `Integrated GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 630` and `NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050`? It is possible for models run slower on GPU than CPU, especially small models with few nodes or small tensors, where just the time needed to upload/download data and initiate the machinery costs more than the computation time. Throwing lots of data with large tensors is where GPU's shine. Another possibility is that CPU fallback is happening, causing stalls between GPU and CPU. Do you see any logging (if you enable it or run it from a command line) warning that some nodes could not be assigned to the preferred execution provider?",
