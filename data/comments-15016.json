        "body": "@skottmckay Thanks for your reply! I'm new to onnx and pytorch, so forgive me if i ask stupidly trivial questions ;)  \r\n`something that could be handled by the aten fallback` you mean setting the `OperatorExportTypes` as `ONNX_ATEN_FALLBACK`? If it is, i would say unfortunately it won't work in my case. An error will raise saying something like `RuntimeError: ONNX export failed: Couldn't export Python operator _Dirichlet`. \r\nCreating a custom operator means i should implement it in c++ and export it to onnx format as described in this [tutorial](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/blob/master/PyTorchCustomOperator/README.md)?",
