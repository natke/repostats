        "body": "@kunaltyagi As george mentioned OnnxRuntime is limited by what native OpenVINO itself can support on the VPU. \r\nUsually when a new operator is supported by OpenVINO team on any plugin like CPU, GPU, VPU with a new release. we just can't directly enable it on ONNXRuntime-OpenVINO EP bridge. \r\n\r\nThe reason being each operator though implemented may have limitations in itself while covering corner cases. so if any of the models we support today have this newly implemented operator, then we test it out to check if it works and mark it as supported. If the op doesn't meet the required conditions, then we reject it and mark it as unsupported in the OpenVINO Execution Provider.\r\n\r\nI just tried to investigate the 3 ops that you mentioned at the top on VPU. Here's the summary.\r\n\r\n1.Abs op is not yet supported by VPU plugin from OpenVINO team. so it can't be enabled on OpenVINO-EP.\r\n   However it is enabled for other plugins like CPU, GPU, etc..\r\n\r\n2.Not op is already enabled for VPU plugin starting from 2021.1 OpenVINO release in the OpenVINO Execution Provider. we will have to update this in our documentation.\r\n\r\n3.ReduceProd op is not yet supported by VPU plugin from OpenVINO team. so it can't be enabled on OpenVINO-EP.\r\n   However it is enabled for other plugins like CPU, GPU, etc..\r\n",
