Meanwhile, we're still working together to keep tuning the API till it's good and general for all partners. It (the API) may be considered to be pushed into ONNX as ONNXIFI v2 if needed, for example.",

        "body": "@linkerzhang @yuanbyu Thanks for your reply and happy holiday! I agree that ONNX Runtime has good momentum and I like the idea of its full ONNX spec compliance. I think the goal of ONNX organization in some extent is to reduce the 'fragmentation' in the ecosystem, and we shouldn't re-invent the wheel for similar 'standards' to support accelerators from multiple vendors (to me, ONNXIFI and ONNX Runtime are quite similar, and please correct if my understanding is wrong). Do we have some forum in ONNX side to discuss the direction? I believe the chip/IP vendors will also be interested in the clarification, so that they can invest properly moving forward. ",
