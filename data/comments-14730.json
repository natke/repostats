        "body": "Hi George,\nThank you for your quick response i missed the email with you response this\nis why i haven't answered yet. I haven't tried it yet with the version\n1.14.0 and different tensort i downgrade it to 1.13.1 and it worked. I\nsupposed as you suggested with Tensort 8.5 it might work. Also, i suppose i\nmust upgrade cuda and cudnn to work with this version. I used to work with\ntensorflow library with creating my deep learning library fro source and\nthey had an table with associated python version tensorflow and cuda\nversion. Is there a simiral table for onnx runtime?\n\nThank you very much,\nBest regards,\nVasilis\n\nOn Tue, Mar 7, 2023, 12:01 AM George Wu ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> Does it work now after updating TensorRT version to 8.5?\n>\n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/14730#issuecomment-1457074533>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABI6YZTCB5XHALT7YYIZ5YDW2ZNE5ANCNFSM6AAAAAAU7MOTJQ>\n> .\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID:\n> ***@***.***>\n>\n",
