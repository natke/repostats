The error you're getting from the linker indicates it can't find what it needs.\r\n\r\nIf you're trying to run on the emulator though I would expect the build needs to use the library matching the architecture of the machine the emulator is running on, which typically would not be arm64.\r\n\r\nSo possibly this:\r\n`set(ONNX_RUNTIME_LIB ${precompiled_DIR}/jni/arm64-v8a/libonnxruntime.so)`\r\n\r\nneeds to adjust for whether you're building something targeting the emulator vs. an actual Android device. Based on the path in the NDK toolchain having `prebuild/windows-x86_64` in it, the x86_64 binary from the ORT package is what you should be linking against when using the emulator.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"273\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/979079/184246850-26856e09-d77d-4577-bca7-88d118c73709.png\">\r\n\r\n",
