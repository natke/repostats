        "body": "Here is a link to a tutorial I wrote for how I fixed this on Windows 10 with Python 3.7.\r\nI basically installed the Cuda toolkit and the CuDNN libraries to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nThe onnx runtime website shows how to install with ``pip install onnxruntime`` for CPU and ``pip install onnxruntime-gpu`` for CUDA support, but I think a lot of people fall into a gotcha because the OnnxRuntime site assumes you have all CUDA prereqs installed already and doesn't clearly list these on their website.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is in written form with screencaps and also links to a video to show proof of fix as well. \r\nPlease feel free to leave comments here or on my medium if the solution does not work for you as I do check back and make fixes based on feedback. Thanks.\r\nhttps://ashley-tharp.medium.com/install-onnxruntime-on-windows-2ad5ed8f4a50",
