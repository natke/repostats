There were documentation updates (since the release branch was made) that Xcode complains about, so we disabled them like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/d3f859fe3063bdfc4b2fdadbd46985b3742b9aec/objectivec/src/cxx_api.h#L6-L14\r\n\r\nThis was one fix to the Objective-C code but I think it should be ok to use the 1.9 version if you worked around this issue. Its usage of the C/C++ API hasn't changed recently. But to be safe in case other issues arise, you could try building your custom build from 1.9 too.\r\n\r\nBTW, we plan to come up with an easier way to package a custom built ORT into pods.",

Since the error says `No opset import for domain ''`, I suspect that some specs info are missed in `ort` model? Not sure whether this is the case but clearly there are not any imports for the `ort` model here (the 2nd image). Also the input/output dimensions are missed, which worries me quite a lot as well.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"496\" alt=\"onnx_specs\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8852730/135138225-90e7f537-1979-44bd-b71f-111e3e739010.png\">\r\n<img width=\"489\" alt=\"ort_specs\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8852730/135138232-85a16560-5b2f-4c44-80eb-3a1d9866883c.png\">\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Thank you for the insights @gwang-msft! I do understand that a partitioned graph can harm the performance and have no problem seeing that maybe using CoreML can be instead slower. Weird thing is that I tried 1) ORT CPU, 2) CoreML CPU only, 3) CoreML, and they all run at exact same inference time (1500ms +/- <10ms, a big hefty model). I am not sure whether I created the session and its ep correctly.\r\n\r\n- The onnxruntime python library for conversion is the pre-built 1.9.0 version\r\n- The onnxruntime ios library was compiled from source code with `--use_coreml` and `--minimal_build=extended`\r\n- Shouldn't turning `coreml_options.useCPUOnly = true/false` make a difference? Maybe CoreML CPU is slower than CoreML EP, even though they are both slower than ORT CPU. This doesn't happen in my case.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience. This will really help me a lot.\r\n\r\nHow I configured ORT CPU:\r\n```swift\r\n  env = try ORTEnv(loggingLevel: ORTLoggingLevel.verbose)\r\n  let options = try ORTSessionOptions()\r\n  // let ep_options = ORTCoreMLExecutionProviderOptions()\r\n  // ep_options.useCPUOnly = true\r\n  // try options.appendCoreMLExecutionProvider(with: ep_options)\r\n  session = try ORTSession(env: env, modelPath: modelPath, sessionOptions: options)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow I configured CoreML:\r\n```swift\r\n  env = try ORTEnv(loggingLevel: ORTLoggingLevel.verbose)\r\n  let options = try ORTSessionOptions()\r\n  let ep_options = ORTCoreMLExecutionProviderOptions()\r\n  // ep_options.useCPUOnly = true \r\n  try options.appendCoreMLExecutionProvider(with: ep_options)\r\n  session = try ORTSession(env: env, modelPath: modelPath, sessionOptions: options)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow I configured CoreML CPU only:\r\n```swift\r\n  env = try ORTEnv(loggingLevel: ORTLoggingLevel.verbose)\r\n  let options = try ORTSessionOptions()\r\n  let ep_options = ORTCoreMLExecutionProviderOptions()\r\n  ep_options.useCPUOnly = true \r\n  try options.appendCoreMLExecutionProvider(with: ep_options)\r\n  session = try ORTSession(env: env, modelPath: modelPath, sessionOptions: options)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
