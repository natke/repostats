        "body": "@i-netwon,  I was able to score the faster-rcnn model just fine using the OnnxRuntime C# API and the sample test data that comes with the model, using [this code snippet](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/csharp/test/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Tests/InferenceTest.cs#L21).\r\n\r\nAs sckottmckay mentioned,  the ML.NET project is under a different [repo](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning), but uses OnnxRuntime  library under the hood. \r\n\r\nIn the  `AdjustDimensions()` function [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/src/Microsoft.ML.OnnxTransformer/OnnxTransform.cs#L289), the dimensions are converted from (3, -1, -1) to (3, 1, 1), with the  assumption that the input node shape will match the shape of the input tensor later on at scoring time. However,  the faster-rcnn model has dynamic axes, and the input node shape will not be equal to  shape of the input tensor at scoring time. The input tensor's shape needs to be set correctly, otherwise the `System.Numerics.Tensor` class will throw the message you see above.\r\n\r\nA fix for this is to pass the tensor shape values as part of the dataset, or else as a user argument (both require code changes in the OnnxTransform codebase however).\r\n\r\nIf you just need to score the model in C# somehow (and don't have ML.NET dependency) you can use the snippet I pointed to above.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
