        "body": "If only the first run with a specific input shape is slow and the subsequent runs with the same input shape are faster, this usually means you have a lot of Conv nodes in your model. By default, the logic in the CUDA EP for Conv is to query CuDNN to find the \"most optimal\" Conv algo for a given filter shape/input shape and cache it for subsequent runs. This query takes up the most time in the first run. \r\n\r\nThat is why for most dynamic shape models, users actually set this field (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/694389a85d35668859c33915849a0c0dd3667969/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.h#L270) to DEFAULT (the default value is actually EXHAUSTIVE - which asks CuDnn to search exhaustively for the best Conv algo). If DEFAULT is used, CuDNN is no longer queried and the default Conv algo is used. The trade-off involved is that the first run will now be much faster but the subsequent runs ***might*** be a bit slower simply because the default algo may not be the best algo for the filter/input shapes.\r\n\r\nYou can get access to this API by upgrading to 1.6 or the latest 1.7.

Spend more time in the first run to find the optimal algo and have the subsequent runs run much faster\r\n2. Set the also to default and have all the runs run at the same speed albeit the perf may not be the optimal that you can get for this model. \r\nIs there any reason none of these 2 solutions work for you? Can you elaborate why?",
