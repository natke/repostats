        "body": "@TratsiakY Agreed. As an outside contributor, I created the [same issue](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/3879) a while back. After some head-banging, I ended up adding a couple [C++ examples](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/samples/c_cxx/model-explorer) myself to the repo that I thought were much easier to follow than the other examples.\r\n\r\nIn the master branch, I've updated several aspects of the C++ API since the last release (including the addition of a new Experimental API that allows for more modern C++ code) that should make life easier (see the model-explorer example). You will need to download and build from source in order to take advantage of the latest additions.\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot of room for improvement on the C++ documentation front. My best suggestion is review the python documentation [here](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/python/api_summary.html) to understand the nomenclature of the API and then read the header file directly. Most of the public-facing API calls are not documented at this point however the function names resemble the python docs close enough that it's reasonable to refer to the python docs for guidance.",

        "body": "> We've [some samples](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/samples#CC). What's missing?\r\n\r\nFirst of all I should to note that examples are not documentation. Seems, that onnxruntime proposes powerful possibilities, but the absence of the clear documentation that describe classes, their parameters,  structures for input and output data, makes it not user friendly. If developers want to build the strong community around the project, the excellent and clear documentation should be written at first.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the documentation results to spend a lot of time (time is money, as you know) on reading source code and examples decomposition. Especially for humans like me, who haven't strong skills in cpp, but who is going to transfer their models from python to c++. Thus, comprehensive  and clear documentation is a way to strong community and satisfied users. I hope on understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jgbradley1 thank you for reply",

Please describe.**\r\nIt is taking me a long time to understand some basic features of the C++ API.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- ONNX Runtime version (you are using): latest (10 March 2021)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThis is essentially re-opening this stale issue: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/4491\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I see the C/C++ API as the most relevant one in the project (I know I am probably in a minority here) since the power of onnxruntime is that it can run pre-trained models quickly and for potentially any OS without the hassle of Python installation for users, doesn't rely on .NET, etc.. However, it seems to be the least-well documented part of the project.\r\n\r\nI should also say, that part of my problem is that simplest example in the c_cxx samples (the mnist sample) isn't working for me for some strange reason (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/6947). I think if it were, I would be able to find answer to my most basic questions by stepping through the sample in the debugger. But, since the model is invalid to the sample program, I cannot currently do this. I don't see the imagenet sample as particularly useful since it really isn't easily run in a debugging environment. The model-explorer samples only 'explore' the beginning and endings of a model. I am currently not interested in the transfer learning stuff, and I also don't have any use for the fs_lib at the moment. In any case, I didn't see much in there to answer my most basic of questions about how to get started.\r\n\r\nHere is a short list of basic things I am trying to figure out and should be (in my opinion) plain from either complete documentation (class list, method descriptions, enums, defines, etc.---you know, API reference documentation) or from the example code:\r\n\r\n-how do I step through a model and get all the information available on each layer? (the answer to this may be 'learn the protobuf API', but I feel that any implementation of protobufs should provide instructions for using that implementation)\r\n\r\n-in particular, how do I determine the type needed by the input layer?\r\n\r\n-how do I figure out how to pack my input data into the right container so that it fits into the input layer? (this question is very hard to answer from poring through the samples and the API header and I feel that it should be patently obvious) \r\n\r\nOne suggestion I have is to provide a sample .onnx model along with a basic sample that shows how to interact with it. I am not sure why the 3rd party mnist samples from the model zoo won't load for me, but they don't. I also had to do some hacking to get the model in a state where the compiled sample program could reach it. It would be nice if this was part of the sample suite so that developers wouldn't have to spend the time mucking about with this. As mentioned in the stale issue I linked above, a full-blown API reference manual would also be very nice.\r\n\r\nLet me finish by saying that I am really happy that Microsoft has put this software out there! I am already contributing to the project in my tiny little way and I am super excited to see it develop. I must also say that the response I have gotten from the dev team on issues so far has been super fast and super helpful.
