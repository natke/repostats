        "body": "Technically, it is all because we can't find a working centos armv7l docker image.  There is one for centos7 but it is not functional. And CentOS8/UBI even refused to support armv7l . So we can't do it like what we are doing for x86_64 and aarch64: build it on CentOS7 and assume it is suitable for most Linux distros.\r\n\r\nSo the question becomes whether we should provide a special build just for Raspberry Pi OS  32-bit and where to host it? Pypi is not the right place because the wheel won't conform to any manylinux standard. piwheels  seems to be a good choice. But, do you know which  Raspberry Pi OS version and gcc version it uses? \r\n\r\nBTW, it's very easy to cross-compile a binary for C/C++/java/C#/..., but not for python. Python's setuptools doesn't support cross-compiling at all. And I can't get the CentOS7 armv7l docker image running with qemu on x86_64. So I ran out of my methods. \r\n\r\n",
