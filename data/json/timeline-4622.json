        "body": "Right. \r\n\r\nData parallelism means onnxruntime can run multiple inference on the same session(model) in parallel. And for each inference, if your batch size>1, in some nodes onnxruntime can run these samples in parallel. \r\nmodel parallelism onnxruntime can run multiple parts of the model in parallel by using the parallel executor, which is not enabled by default. Please reference onnxruntime's document for how to enable it. \r\n\r\nHowever, these things only applies to the default CPU provider and CUDA provider. Even the CUDA provider supports model parallelism, but it doesn't support multiple GPU card yet, so probably it's not what you want. \r\n ",
