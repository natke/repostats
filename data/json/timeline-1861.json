        "body": "Yes, it seems like the python interpreter doesn't know the location of `openvino_mo.py` and `openvino_emitter.py` scripts.\r\n\r\n`openvino_mo.py` and `openvino_emitter.py` are the python scripts required for using the OpenVINO EP, and are invoked by the python interpreter from within OpenVINO EP.  So, the location of these two files must be known to the python interpreter. This can be achieved in two ways:-\r\n\r\n**1.  Installing the .whl package**\r\n   When you build ONNX Runtime with the `--build-wheel` option, a .whl package is generated in the `<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT>/build/<OS>/<build_type>/dist` directory. This .whl package contains all the libraries and scripts required for running the application, and can be installed using `pip install` command which would install the libraries and scripts to known locations. As long as the python environment of `pip` and runtime python interpreter is the same, the runtime python interpreter will know where to find the files installed by `pip`. So in this case, nothing else needs to be done for the `openvion_mo.py` and `openvino_emitter.py` scripts to be accessible from anywhere.\r\n\r\n**2. Directly using the executables from the build folder**\r\n  If you have not installed the `.whl` package and would like to run the application by accessing the executables and libraries in the `<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT>/build` folder, then the location of the python scripts needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Python interpreter searches all the directories listed in this variable for modules/scripts. This can be achieved with the command:-\r\n   `export PYTHONPATH=<full_directory_path_to_the_py_scripts>:$PYTHONPATH`\r\n",
