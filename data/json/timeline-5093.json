        "body": "I wonder how the parallelization happen. ProcessPoolExecutor probably uses pickle to share the context of function transform. That would mean python tries to pickle `sess` and InferenceSession is not pickable. To do that, you need to wrap the InferenceSession in a pickable class. This class has to hold the onnx data. We should probably raise an exception when the user tries to pickle an InferenceSession object.",
