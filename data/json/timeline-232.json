Hence it's quite possible that an onnx model might not work on the EPs directly. ORT implements the full ONNX standard and guarantees to execute your model even if EPs cannot do so. It does this by falling back on the CPU implementation of ops. Please read the design doc for more details.\r\n\r\n> * How is onnx runtime different from TVM Compiler?\r\nORT is an inferencing runtime. TVM is a compiler for DNNs. Different objectives.\r\n\r\nAlso, please open a new issue if you've any further questions/clarifications.\r\n",

                "body": "I am further asking the following questions (in a new issue as suggested) with relevance and continuation to the replies in the [comment](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/232#issuecomment-734060575) by @pranavsharma \r\n\r\n- CPU was provided under Execution Providers in the design document. May I understand the reason?\r\n\r\n- How is standalone execution provider different from execution provider along with ONNX Runtime?\r\n\r\n- Why is the need of hardware independent optimizations (after converting ONNX model to in-memory graph rep) ?\r\n\r\n- How are the sub-graphs after partitioning scheduled on to different EPs? Do we need to write a script defining the priorities for scheduling?\r\n\r\n- As few execution providers are not having the implementation of few onnx operators, would it be possible to implement those operators in execution providers? (to avoid the fallback onto cpu and hit bad with performance)\r\n\r\nTrying to connect all the dots of understanding. Any support with patience is a great help to me. Thank you.\r\n",
