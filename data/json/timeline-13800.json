It would probably be significantly faster with the WebGL backend, but [it lacks quantization op support](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/13800).\r\n\r\nThe quantized model comes in at less than 50mb, and seems to match the accuracy of the non-quantized (>150mb) model.\r\n\r\nHere's the code and demo:\r\n* https://github.com/josephrocca/SimVP-web\r\n* https://josephrocca.github.io/SimVP-web/demo/simple.html\r\n\r\nMy next step is to create a version of the [training and conversion notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/josephrocca/80c4a9814621d228dfb3d262a26a0806) that can train on arbitrary videos that the user uploads.\r\n\r\n(I'm also wondering whether some sort of diffusion-like process could be used to prevent the increasing blurriness as we predict further into the future. Maybe an \"un-diffusion\" process could actually just be \"embedded\" as extra frames between the \"actual\" frames during training? Or maybe it'd need to be a separate model. If anyone has any thoughts on this I'd love to hear them)\r\n\r\nThanks to the paper authors for publishing and open sourcing this!",

The main reason I want the model quantized is to reduce the time it takes for the client to download it.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is the WebGL backend is just missing a lot of ops compared to Wasm backend. The unquantized version of my model also has `Erf` - [just like yours, apparently](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/13729), which the WebGL backend doesn't support.\r\n\r\nLike I said in my first comment on this issue, I hope that WebGPU will solve these compatibility problems by just compiling the native GPU code to WGSL, so we have ~full op support without lots of burden on the ONNX Runtime Web team.",
