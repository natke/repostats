After doing a bit more reading it seems what I considered \"dynamic quantization\" with QLinearOps was basically a hacky workaround where output scales where statically fixed AOT during calibration, but where the inputs were dynamically computed.\r\n\r\nI guess this was never explicitly supported since it differs from what pytorch/tf define as \"dynamic quantization.\" ",
