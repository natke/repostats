The operator kernels and model execution in a minimal build is exactly the same as a full build, so there should be no difference in inferencing performance between the two. As such, I would have expected you use a full build until the model is finalized, at which point you switch to creating a minimal build.\r\n\r\nAlso, ORT only needs to be rebuilt if you change the kernels required by the model.

        "body": "While developing the model itself, I'd like to try several kinds of models,\nand see what best fits the use case. For example, I try first with the GRU\nmodel and want to compare with the LSTM model, I need to recompile the\nwhole onnxruntime library, which takes around 1 hour to complete. One other\nreason is that I'd like to make this onnxruntime library a common\nlibrary to be used for several applications. In this case, the model will\nbe chosen by the app side, not by the library itself, and the final link\nshould be done on the app side. It would be ideal that each app can have\nonly the operators required by its own model.\n\n2021년 3월 8일 (월) 오후 3:50, Scott McKay <notifications@github.com>님이 작성:\n\n> What's the reason why you are using a minimal build if the model is\n> constantly changing?

They're not dynamically added at runtime, so I don't believe it's possible to have individual apps specifying additional kernels after the ORT library is built - what's enabled when the ORT library is built is fixed.\r\n\r\nAFAIK it's a similar setup with TF Lite. If you [select ops](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_select ) to include you need to rebuild.

(There is also [StackOverflow Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50443808/how-to-reduce-the-tensorflow-lite-binary-size-with-only-the-operators-needed) remaining, but all references in the answers seems broken.

Instead of using `BuiltinOpResolver`, define my own `MinimalOpResolver` and  add only operators used in the model. In this way, other operator functions  are not referenced at the final linking, only specified operator functions remain in the final binary. ",

        "body": "I'm building with TF Lite with custom `MinimalOpResolver`. So to make the question simple, can the registration of the operator be done at the app side when initializing onnxruntime? As far as I understand, current operator registration is in provider code like `cpu_execution_provider.cc`. So by giving `--include-ops-by-config` option for build script, it modifies this file to register only the operators in the onnxruntime library.\r\n1) this selecting operators seems almost final stage, can it be done without compiling the whole onnxruntime source code?\r\n2) can this part be separated from the onnxruntime library building? i.e. maybe separate build script into two steps, one is compiling all the source codes, and the other is modifying provider code and linking into libary.",
