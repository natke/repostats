        "body": "> I managed to build and take out onnxruntime for a spin and I had a bunch of absolute newbie questions. I apologize if this is not the right forum for this or if this is already available in the API docs.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Is it fair to say that we can use onnxruntime to build an inference application specifically for ONNX models, with some additional code on top ? (something similar to tensorflow-serving)\r\n**Answer** onnxruntime is a library to infer ONNX models. You're free to develop any application on top of it.\r\n\r\n> 2. We do not do any sort of training in onnxruntime. This is purely for running inference from the pre-trained ONNX model. Is that correct?\r\n**Answer** As of now this is correct.\r\n\r\n> 3. Question on concurrency: I noticed the API provides parallel execution with a session thread pool size. Is this like application threads as opposed to the concurrency that we can control by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS (in case we use the MKL_DNN library as execution provider) How do these two relate? Does session_thread_pool_size override OMP_NUM_THREADS ?\r\n**Answer** As of now the session threadpool size affects parallel execution mode only and is independent of the OMP_NUM_THREADS.\r\n\r\n> 4. Is it possible to batch multiple input requests together while running it via the InferenceSession ?\r\n**Answer** Use the batch dimension in your input tensor.\r\n",
