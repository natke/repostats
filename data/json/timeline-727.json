        "body": "Hi, thanks for the questions.\r\n\r\nFor profiling (Q1 & Q3), we recommend using [PIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download/).  I'm not sure what it’ll make of CUDA, but ultimately that all boils down to WDDM work submission so at least some amount of this should show up in timing captures. In addition to PIX we also have GPUView (which ships as part of the Windows Performance Toolkit) which is good at giving an all up system view of how the GPU is being used and shared across all processes so you can see exactly how the various workload are effectively sharing the GPU.\r\n\r\nQ2: In general, CPU thread priority doesn’t impact GPU scheduling priorities.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to impact GPU scheduling priorities, but that’s typically better to be avoided by regular application. Windows will automatically boost any process that is in focus. In specific instances (like VR) there are mechanism for a process to ask for a global “realtime” priority on their work submission… but applications that do this are required to have admin privilege and have to be incredibly careful to avoid totally screwing up the user experience. For regular compute app there should be no reason for application to touch our default policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
