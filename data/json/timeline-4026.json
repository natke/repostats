They can be different. For example, you may build onnxruntime in a clean docker container that doesn't have protobuf installed, then you won't see such build error anymore. \r\n\r\n2. It is a concern only if you static link to onnxruntime .  In this case, please turn on the following cmake option:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/cmake/CMakeLists.txt#L98\r\n\r\n3.  The last choice, go to onnxruntime's protobuf submodule directory, update it to the version you want, like:\r\n```bash\r\ngit fetch --tags\r\ngit reset --hard v3.12.1\r\n```",
