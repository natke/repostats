        "body": "So there are a lot of things interacting here. I boils down to an out of memory error from the arena that tries to allocate a large block for the whole run to use. It hits an edge case where it doesn't throw when it can't do the allocation, a nullptr is returned but that isn't checked for, and the nullptr gets stuffed in another stucture that we use when we need some memory for an Node. When we go to use that memory we get the nullptr (but assume it's a valid pointer to an offset within a large block) and that is passed to the cudaMemcpy as the destination address. In my testing where I saw an allocation failure instead of cudaMemcpy error it didn't hit this edge case - so it's actually the same root cause just with different error messages.\r\n\r\nThis happens on the second run as on the first one the arena doesn't know how large a block size to use so we allocate smaller blocks as we go along (if you run onnx_test_runner with '-v' you'll see output from BFCArena where these blocks are allocated). On the second run we go to allocate the large block, but we don't currently have a way to cleanup the smaller blocks from the first run which we're not going to use, leading to the out of memory error as now you essentially need 2x the memory (left over blocks from the first run and the single large block of the same total size for the second run). This is why TensorRT works with the batch size as it's not using this arena.\r\n\r\nAdditionally onnx_test_runner is reporting success for multiple runs even though only the first one is passing, which is why it's harder to notice the error when using that. \r\n\r\nShort term I'll see if we can handle the large block allocation failure better. Performance won't be totally optimal but it should still be able to use the smaller blocks from the first run so it shouldn't be too bad. There may be some other options but I'll need to test those out better and they may take a lot longer to validate and implement.",

When the batch size gets large enough the initial run will be successful (no memory pattern in use) but the second will fail to allocate the memory pattern block.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this failure is that we still have the smaller blocks from the first run allocated, as BFCArena has no logic to free those. This essentially results in 2x the memory being required to run the model.\r\n\r\nThere was inconsistency in BFCArena::Extend which on one path threw an exception if it couldn't do the allocation, and on another just returned false (resulting in Alloc returning a nullptr). Make the behavior consistent by always throwing if BFCArena fails to find a buffer to return. There are a large number of places in the code where we assume Alloc returns a valid pointer so throwing will result in more correct behavior as a whole. It's also consistent with what happens when CUDA or the standard library fails to allocate memory.\r\n\r\nNext, update ExecutionFrame to check for this failure and not insert a memory block entry if it happens. With the existing code if BFCArena Alloc returned a nullptr we happily inserted that in the blocks, delaying detection of the failure to when we attempted to use the block in AllocateMLValueTensorSelfOwnBufferHelper. This was the error reported in the Issue.\r\n\r\nFinally update AllocateMLValueTensorSelfOwnBufferHelper to expect a location may not have a block. A log message will be provided when the block allocation fails so it's not necessary to have more on each individual allocation that would have used the block. Falls through to default behavior of doing a normal allocation.\r\n\r\nFuture: \r\n  - May be able to use the logic from the Training code to figure out the memory pattern block size upfront. \r\n  - It would also be possible to 'fix' this if you knew how large a block was required and allocated that upfront in the arena. Requires a run with Info level logging to know that value from the BFCArena output, and a configuration mechanism to be able to tell BFCArena to use that as the initial size for a specific allocator. \r\n  - Possibly BFCArena could detect and free unused blocks when an Extend call fails. May not be trivial to do so, and need to think through if/how that would impact scenarios with concurrent requests and/or scenarios where a mix of batch sizes are provided as input (as the memory pattern block size is specific to the batch size). \r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**\r\nFix issue running BERT-Squad. #4008 \r\n",
