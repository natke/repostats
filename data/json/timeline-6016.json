Whenever we do a patch release of onnxruntime, we'll directly update the previous docker image instead of create a new one, or we'll just delete the previous image.\r\n\r\nSecond, we decide to keep our image small, to not include anything unnecessary. nvcc is not needed for running ONNX models, so I removed it. Also, nvcc is not a Microsoft product, it is a proprietary software owned by Nvidia. If a user need it, we suggest the user directly consult Nvidia. \r\n\r\nAbout the python: we used to have conda in our images, it makes license issues more complicated.  So I removed it. I replaced it with the python binary from Ubuntu official repo.  The license is covered by https://github.com/microsoft/containerregistry/blob/master/legal/Container-Images-Legal-Notice.md .\r\n\r\nPlease also note these images are made solely for Azure customers. https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/dockerfiles/LICENSE-IMAGE.txt.  They must be used on Microsoft Azure Services only. However, you're free to get our source code and docker files to build them by your own, then you don't need to insert such license notices and you get can nvcc back by changing the line:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.cuda#L17\r\nTo\r\n```\r\nFROM nvidia/cuda:10.2-cudnn8-devel\r\n```",

Reading the docs, no version of Python is specified, nor is NVCC mentioned, so it was improper of me to rely upon them. I apologize if I came off as frustrated, and I appreciate your work here.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, thanks for the heads up on the License Agreement! I'll rebuild from Open Source.",
