        "body": "Hi,\r\nCurrently, the application can only specify the model that it wants to execute on a single MyriadX chip.  The underlying Myriad toolchain automatically distributes individual computations from a model on to the various parallel SHAVE cores and collects the results back. It is not currently possible for an application to control execution on specific SHAVE cores within a single MyriadX chip.\r\n The only way to parallellize application at this stage is at a more coarse granular level by having multiple MyriadX cores (such as a VAD-M accelerator https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/vision-accelerator-movidius-vpu )",

        "body": "When using onnxruntime API's, one would first need to create a 'session' object that binds a model to a hardware backend. To execute inference on that session, one would call session.run() with the input data.\r\n\r\n When we create a session with a model for a VPU, we automatically choose one VPU to run the model on, and a corresponding session.run() would run inference on that device. One way to parallelize execution on multiple VPUs is to create multiple session objects that would cause each to bind to a different VPU (done automatically by OpenVINO EP) and call session.run() on each of them independently.\r\n\r\n Alternately, if you are using the multiple VPU's specifially from the VAD-M hardware mentioned above, parallel execution can be done via a single session object. To run multiple inference on multiple data blobs parallelly, simply batch all the blobs and pass the batched blob as input data to session.run(). The OpenVINO EP internally would unbatch the blobs and schedule parallel execution on the VPU units on the VAD-M hardware and return their results in a batched way. Sample application code to achieve this is available here: (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/docs/execution_providers/OpenVINO-ExecutionProvider.md#application-code-changes-for-vad-m-performance-scaling). However, this functionality is currently only available with the VAD-M hardware. With single VPUs you would need to use the multiple sessions approach.",
