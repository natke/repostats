        "body": "Glad you got it working, torkeldanielsson :)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to report that I got \"GPU model loading and inference\" working without installing the whole CUDA 9.1 package. The currently required NVIDIA dlls to run the GPU version of \"C_Api_Sample\" are cudnn64_7.dll and cudart64_91.dll on my laptop.\r\nI believe I hadn't installed any NVIDIA CUDA package in the past and shouldn't have any other dll files, from the list I mentioned in my previous post, stored on my computer. I believe that nvml.dll gets installed along with the NVIDIA display driver, though.\r\n\r\nYou can extract cudnn64_7.dll and cudart64_91.dll from the temp folder that the CUDA installer unpacks the installation files to at the start of the installation process.\r\n\r\nI also had to add my app in the NVIDIA \"Manage 3D Settings->Program Settings\" and set the preferred graphics processor to HIGH-performance NVIDIA processor since I have an integrated graphics card besides the NVIDIA one.",
