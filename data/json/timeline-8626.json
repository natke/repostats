        "body": "> Is the expectation that any consumer of onnxruntime has to explicitly list all of the libraries that onnxruntime depends on when linking against the target?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nCan you use the \"onnxruntime_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES\" variable? \r\n\r\nThe context of the list is not supposed to be transparent to you.  Because very likely you already have some of the libraries installed in your system(e.g. protobuf) or in your current build system. In these case it will not work properly. So you need to very clearly know which lib onnxruntime depends on, You can't treat it as a black box.  And you need to add them after onnxruntime_\\* libraries, not before.  I think @chenta knows how to do this. \r\n\r\nMy expectation is most users will use the shared library(instead of the static ones) to avoid this business. \r\n\r\nYou may write me an email about your usage and detailed requirement. Then we can discuss how to provide the best solution for you. I can help make the changes in ORT if any change is needed. \r\n",

        "body": "Explicitly listing the libraries (or using onnxruntime_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES) doesn't work for us because for some reason CMake if very stubborn abouting putting onnxruntime_* libs very late in the link order (after dependencies like onnx and protobuf) causing it to fail to link. The only solution we've found for this is target_link_libraries PUBLIC. To be more explicit, what I believe you are suggesting:\r\n`target_link_libraries(OUR_BIN PUBLIC onnxruntime_lib SomeOtherLibs onnx protobuf ...)`\r\nfails because despite the ordering it puts onnxruntime_lib at the end (due to not understanding the dependencies for the static library for the reasons you outline in your comment above, in this case ordering the list is not sufficient). On the other hand, using:\r\n`taret_link_libraries(onnxruntime_lib PUBLIC onnx protobuf ...)`\r\n`target_link_librarires(OUR_BIN PUBLIC onnruntime_lib SomeOtherLibs ...)`\r\nworks correctly.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate some clarification on the motivation for the guidence to avoid target_link_librarires for static libs. In particular, I think the statement that static libraries aren't linked isn't relevant because target_link_libraries explicitly serves the purpose of establishing dependencies required for libraries linked against a static lib. From the cmake doc: \"This also works transitively through a static library. Since a static library does not link, it does not consume the object files from object libraries referenced this way. Instead, the object files become transitive link dependencies of the static library.\"",

        "body": "Let's say, if you have code:\r\n```\r\ntarget_link_libraries(OUR_BIN PUBLIC onnxruntime_lib SomeOtherLibs onnx protobuf ...)\r\n```\r\nAnd all these libs are static libs, and none of the static libs has target_link_librarires as I suggested. Then the libraries will show up as the exact order as you specified in the final link command. And if you are not satisfied with the order, you can easily adjust it.  I would suggest to figure out why \"despite the ordering it(cmake) puts onnxruntime_lib at the end\".  It must because some other code did it. For example, after this line you have another target_link_libraries which links onnxruntime_lib  again.",
