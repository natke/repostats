        "body": "Onnx runtime depends on some other libraries like onnx/protobuf/... . If we provided onnx runtime as a static library, you will still need these extra libraries to use. Here we have two choices:\r\n\r\n1. onnxruntime distribute these third party libraries together within the same package. A drawback is we will force you using the versions we provide. You can't use a different version of onnx or protobuf. Generally speaking, I don't see people do this.  If your system has already installed protobuf, and we tried to provide a different on and override it ,...  It sounds dangerous.\r\n\r\n2. onnxruntime  asks you get the third party libraries from somewhere and install it into your system. For example, you can get protobuf from  'apt-get' .  ONNX users can install onnx by:\r\n```bash\r\napt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler\r\nexport CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\"\r\npip install ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, when the problem comes to onnxruntime, we can't get ONNX from apt-get install. And there is no formal way to **install** ONNX as a C/C++ library. Second, onnxruntime depends on a beta version of eigen. You can't get it from any package manager. Though you still can install it manually. \r\n\r\nTheoretically it is possible to provide onnxruntime as a static library, but it's hard to use it correctly. ",

        "body": "If anyone interested in linking onnxruntime statically on Windows, here are the steps I followed:\r\n- Download onnxruntime (e.g. in C:\\Software)\r\n```\r\n git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime\r\n cd onnxruntime\r\n```\r\n- Build onnxruntime w/o the shared library option (as suggested in #1472.\r\n`.\\build.bat --config Release --parallel`\r\n\r\nThis will create all required `.lib` files into the build/config folder you specified. Note that there is no `onnxruntime.lib`. In your application, you just need to link multiple libraries that onnxrunime uses.\r\n\r\n- I used CMake to create a test application. In CMakeLists.txt file, add the following:\r\n```\r\ntarget_include_directories(\r\n    ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE \r\n    C:/Software/onnxruntime/include/onnxruntime\r\n)\r\n\r\ntarget_link_directories(\r\n    ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE\r\n    C:/Software/onnxruntime/build/Windows/Release\r\n)\r\n\r\ntarget_link_libraries(\r\n    ${PROJECT_NAME}\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_session\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_optimizer\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_providers\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_util\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_framework\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_graph\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_mlas\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_common\r\n    Release/onnxruntime_flatbuffers\r\n    Release/onnx_test_data_proto\r\n    external/onnx/Release/onnx\r\n    external/onnx/Release/onnx_proto\r\n    external/protobuf/cmake/Release/libprotobuf-lite\r\n    external/re2/Release/re2\r\n    external/abseil-cpp/absl/base/Release/absl_base\r\n    external/abseil-cpp/absl/base/Release/absl_throw_delegate\r\n    external/abseil-cpp/absl/container/Release/absl_raw_hash_set\r\n    external/abseil-cpp/absl/hash/Release/absl_hash\r\n    external/abseil-cpp/absl/hash/Release/absl_city\r\n    external/abseil-cpp/absl/hash/Release/absl_low_level_hash\r\n)\r\n```\r\n- Finally, include the .h file in your main.cpp:\r\n`#include \"core/session/onnxruntime_cxx_api.h\"`",

Note I have omitted the build dynamic library option:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime\r\ncd onnxruntime\r\n.\\build.bat --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel --cmake_generator \"Visual Studio 16 2019\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere are the .lib files and headers that I need located after building? I go to Build > Windows > RelWithDebInfo but after that I'm none-the-wiser on where to be looking.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50206336/156563893-925af7f7-58fe-463d-ba69-bfd27f186e4b.png)\r\n\r\nApologies for the newbiness of my question, I'm new to building from source.\r\n\r\nThanks",
