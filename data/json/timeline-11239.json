I tried to use [RNFS](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs), in particular `RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath`, but I couldn't find my onnx model file under all sub-directories of `RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath`, which evaluates to `/data/user/0/com.onnxtestbed/files`. Do you by chance know what I did wrong here or have any suggestions on other ways to accomplish the same thing as expo? Thanks!\r\n",

And after `const MODEL_URL = require('./modelfile.file_extention');`, do you simply do `const session: ort.InferenceSession = await ort.InferenceSession.create(MODEL_URL);`? My model is nothing fancy, it's literally a linear blend operation (see picture below) and has no weights at all. You can also find the `.ort` model in the link to the repo above if you want to give it a try. Also just to make sure we are on the same page, are you using plain react native and not expo and testing it on physical Android phone? Thanks for the help again!\r\n\r\n![183332626-7c6d11fd-e241-4035-8223-aaf6a378e806](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28615340/186822461-7939a7ef-8639-43a5-93af-e6d6757dd446.png)\r\n",

I am using metro and did see a number returned by `require()` like you said. However, I couldn't find helper methods from metro to extract the full file path given an asset ID number. On the other hand, earlier I thought `Image.resolveAssetSource()` can only be used with image asset, but it looks like I can use it to get the link to my `ort` model file as well; in other words, `Image.resolveAssetSource()` works with non-image assets as well, is my understanding correct?\r\n\r\nI also tried the approach you suggested and downloaded the model file onto the temporary folder using `RNFS`. And even though I can see the model file in the temporary directory when I print out all the content of the temporary directory, the model loading still failed when I passed in the file path of the downloaded model file in the temporary directory. The error message is `Error Message: [Error: Can't load a model: No content provider: /data/user/0/com.onnxtestbed/cache/LinearBlend_v001.ort]`. I am running my bare react-native project (no expo) using android studio and testing it on my physical android device. You can find the code to reproduce the error here [https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-issue](https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-issue) (I also realized that in my very original post on the very top, the link to the repo is broken but they are fixed now).\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if you could please let me know what I did wrong in my code, and thank you so much for your help again!",
