        "body": "@snnn after writing a unit test, it seems like onnx-runtime throws an error if I don't supply all the inputs even when they are not used by the requested outputs. I have a simple graph which accepts scalars a,b,c, and computes ab, bc, and ab + bc as separate outputs. When asking for the ab output I get an exception thrown out of the native runtime with the text:\r\n```\r\n2020-02-03 10:31:07.363937739 [E:onnxruntime:, sequential_executor.cc:183 Execute] Non-zero status code returned while running Mul node. Name:'bc' Status Message: /local/ExternalRepositories/onnxruntime/include/onnxruntime/core/framework/op_kernel.h:90 const T* onnxruntime::OpKernelContext::Input(int) const [with T = onnxruntime::Tensor] Missing Input: c:0\r\n```\r\nplus a stack trace. The test fails in Java on this [line](https://github.com/Craigacp/onnxruntime/blob/2b66aeb350f93487ab88c9d8ef35e28d693d2688/java/src/test/java/ai/onnxruntime/InferenceTest.java#L237). The model is checked in [here](https://github.com/Craigacp/onnxruntime/blob/java-num-inputs-fix/onnxruntime/test/testdata/partial-inputs-test.onnx). I built it using TF 1.15 and tf2onnx 1.5.4.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have expected it to work this way, is this a bug in the library, or did I misunderstand the spec? I can't see a specific test in either the C# or Python bindings which check this behaviour.",

Does that sound okay?",

Sometimes, I only need output1, it is easy to only get the output1 by using function:\r\n`ort_session.run(output_names=[\"output1\"], input_feed=features)`\r\nHowever, this would also compute the graph(i.e. fc4, fc5 and fc6) after fc3 which **consuming much time**. Hence, is there a way to only compute the layers fc1, fc2 and fc3 and get output1? \r\n\r\nI know that a simple way is to split the onnx model, however, this will load two models in my program. I only want to use one model.",

                "body": "Is there interest in updating the C++ API to use modern C++ best practices? From what I can tell, the C++ API is just a simple wrapper around the C API. It could in theory be more supportive of modern C++ standards and handle the necessary conversions to the C API.\r\n\r\nFor example, support for `std::string` over `const char *` would improve the ability to integrate with other frameworks/libraries instead of forcing C++ devs to drop down to C-style syntax.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\n// works only because of implicit conversion\r\nsize_t num_nodes = session.GetInputCount();\r\nstd::vector<std::string> input_node_names;\r\nfor (int i=0; i<num_nodes; i++) {\r\n    input_node_names.push_back( session.GetInputName(i, allocator) );\r\n}\r\n\r\nsize_t num_nodes = session.GetOutputCount();\r\nstd::vector<std::string> output_node_names;\r\nfor (int i=0; i<num_nodes; i++) {\r\n    output_node_names.push_back( session.GetOututName(i, allocator) );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when trying to run inferrence:\r\n```\r\n// will not work\r\nstd::vector<Ort::Value> output_tensors = session.Run(Ort::RunOptions{nullptr}, input_node_names.data(), input_tensors.data(), input_tensors.size(), output_node_names.data(), output_node_names.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause `input_node_names` and `output_node_names` are strings.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd support for the string type in the public API functions. This could also lead to simplifying the `Run()` call to something like:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::vector<Ort::Value> output_tensors = session.Run(Ort::RunOptions{nullptr}, input_node_names, input_tensors.data(), input_tensors.size(), output_node_names);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn general, I would appreciate more modern C++ standards supported by the C++ API with direct support for STL containers (i.e. std::vector) and the string type. Perhaps the C++ API could make better use of function templates to allow this - but starting by adding support for the `string` type would be a first step.",
