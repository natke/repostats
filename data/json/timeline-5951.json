        "body": "> I am further asking the following questions (in a new issue as suggested) with relevance and continuation to the replies in the [comment](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/232#issuecomment-734060575) by @pranavsharma\r\n> \r\n> * CPU was provided under Execution Providers in the design document. May I understand the reason?\r\nORT ships with a default EP that can run all ONNX ops on the CPU. This is what we call the CPU EP; it is implemented by ORT and is the fallback for all ops. Other EPs like openvino also run on the CPU but may not implement all ONNX ops since they're third party and hence outside ORT's control. May be our CPU EP should've been called \"Default ORT CPU\" EP.\r\n\r\n> * How is standalone execution provider different from execution provider along with ONNX Runtime?\r\nAlready answered this before.\r\n\r\n> * Why is the need of hardware independent optimizations (after converting ONNX model to in-memory graph rep) ?\r\nTo improve performance. You can read more here https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/docs/ONNX_Runtime_Graph_Optimizations.md.\r\n\r\n> * How are the sub-graphs after partitioning scheduled on to different EPs? Do we need to write a script defining the priorities for scheduling?\r\nNo script is needed. The order in which you register EPs with ORT session determines the preference order for partitioning. EPs that are registered earlier are considered first for assigning nodes/sub-graphs to them. Please read the design doc linked earlier.\r\n\r\n> * As few execution providers are not having the implementation of few onnx operators, would it be possible to implement those operators in execution providers? (to avoid the fallback onto cpu and hit bad with performance)\r\nYes. However, many EPs are third party to ORT (for e.g. openvino and tensorrt) and not open source. Hence they're outside ORT's control.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Trying to connect all the dots of understanding. Any support with patience is a great help to me. Thank you.\r\n\r\n",
