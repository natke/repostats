I agree it'll need to zero them again, but that's very cheap. The JNI code unavoidably makes a bunch of allocations as well, but those are much harder to remove (e.g. we need the names in UTF-8 which is not how they are stored natively in the JVM).\r\n\r\nMaking the native method public is not something I'm likely to do. I'd need to rewrite the JNI code to ensure the input invariants are set properly, and it makes it much easier to crash the VM by messing with the inputs.",

From the \r\n\r\n```\r\n  public Result run(\r\n      Map<String, OnnxTensor> inputs, Set<String> requestedOutputs, RunOptions runOptions)\r\n      throws OrtException {\r\n```\r\n\r\nFunction there are 3 arrays and one object allocated which if I'm running the same model every time could just be re-used. If I supply my own output tensors likely the two input array allocations would still happen. Perhaps some function where I can pass in my own arrays & objects and then the same checks are performed to ensure invariants are set properly?

        "body": "I agree they escape in terms of the escape analysis but the GC should catch them with a young gen collection in G1 easily and they are usually a cheap allocation. Not sure how ZGC deals with them, maybe the generational one will help. I guess that given the remaining allocations are native then the GC doesn't see them so you might not have enough pressure to trigger a young gen G1 collection.\r\n\r\n> If there's some proposal you think would be good to make a sort of 'fast path' into inference I would be happy to make the change too & add relevant tests.\r\n\r\nIt depends how fast a fast path you actually want. There's one which does essentially no allocation on the way in by storing the names as UTF-8 byte arrays stored in a `ByteBuffer`, passing in four arrays (input long*, input char*, output char*, output OnnxValue) that I can write to, and then passing in a list of `OnnxTensor`. The Java code then unpacks the pointers into the input long array, then the native code unpacks the byte buffer pointers into the char* arrays. It would be ugly to use, and relatively hard to make safe (to the point where it might be better to actually have a different session construction factory that binds the names on construction or a separate subclass of OrtSession). What I don't want to do is expose any method that accepts `long[]` as a pointer array as it's far too easy to make that crash everything. ORT always needs to manage the pointers to make sure they are in fact OrtValue pointers within the right lifespan.\r\n\r\nThat will still allocate (at least) two objects per output value, as each `OnnxTensor` needs to contain a `TensorInfo`, at least until we add support for supplying output values. At the point that support is added then this would need to be revised.\r\n\r\nThere are also changes coming which touch this code to incorporate support for sparse tensors which I'd like to land before making any changes to the run code.",
