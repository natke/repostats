        "body": "This is occuring at my C++ component that I am using in C#. I am reusing all data types, so when a new image arrives I just write it to the same buffer of the same InputTensor that is kept during the whole running of the server. The same happens with sessions, as I maintain and reuse them.\r\n\r\nBoth memory Ram and GPU are being maintained under 50% but when this performance degradation occurs it seems the RAM keeps increasing.\r\n\r\nI have also different models running in a pipeline, so it would be impossible to have just one single session. I tried to test with just one model, and different sessions per thread and it could run up to 2 threads well (memory ram stable and execution times stable) but after this number of threads it would show the same bad behavior with memory RAM building up as well.\r\n\r\nI can try to share sessions for the same model.\r\n\r\nAlso I saw this issue ( #https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/4093) which seems to be related with what you said by having different memory pools for each session. By running this with GPU is there any expected performance degradation if we set the session with just 1 thread?\r\n\r\nThank you",
