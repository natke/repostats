        "body": "Hi, I took a look at the model and have a few comments:\r\n\r\n1. The different optimizations levels aren't having an impact because the model appears to have been exported with keep_initializers_as_inputs=True through torch.onnx.export. This signals to the runtime that any of the weights may be overriden at inference time, so none of the optimizations apply. I see this debug message when using the model with onnxruntime_perf_test:\r\n\r\n2020-08-17 08:49:14.6667507 [W:onnxruntime:, graph.cc:863 onnxruntime::Graph::Graph] Initializer 90 appears in graph inp\r\nuts and will not be treated as constant value/weight. This may prevent some of the graph optimizations, like const foldi\r\nng. Move it out of graph inputs if there is no need to override it, by either re-generating the model with latest export\r\ner/converter or with the tool onnxruntime/tools/python/remove_initializer_from_input.py.\r\n\r\n2. I edited the model to remove the weights from the inputs list. This then allowed various optimizations such as Conv+BatchNorm fusion and NCHWc layout transformation to occur. However, the overall performance ended up much worse. I'm seeing that the weights contain denormal numbers which results in a very slow path in the processor (an order of magnitude worse for a multiply/add instruction).\r\n\r\nI'm curious if you are also seeing a slowdown when doing an inference with PyTorch. PyTorch forums point users at torch.set_flush_denormal(true) to enable a CPU mode that improves performance by returning zero instead of attempting to compute the correct denormal. ONNX Runtime does not have an equivalent for that today. I modified the runtime to force this mode on all the threads and then performance improved greatly: ~400ms->150ms. I see the same behavior using the Intel DNNL execution provider.\r\n\r\nIf the weights could be post-processed to clip very small numbers, that should avoid the denormal problem. I've just started seeing more models with this problem recently: I don't have a plan at this time of how the runtime might have an equivalent to set_flush_denormal (or go the TensorFlow and always flush denormals to zero).
