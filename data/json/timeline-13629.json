First, please read this: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/compiler-tools.html\r\n\r\nThe link above says: \"Anaconda 5.0 switched from OS-provided compiler tools to our own toolsets. \" It means: there are two toolsets. The one provided by your operating system, and the one from conda. Their versions are different. Generally speaking, you don't want to mix using them. \r\n\r\nFor example, you can get numpy either from pypi.org by using \"pip install\", or from conda's repo by using \"conda install\". You'd better either to get all your packages from pypi, or all from conda.  The onnxruntime package you got from pypi.org used the toolchain from the system, and the numba package, you know, was from conda and used the conda toolchain.  One process can only have one libstdc++.so.6. The one provided by your OS is older. So if the older one gets loaded first,  packages who depend on the newer one wouldn't work. \r\n",
