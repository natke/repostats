[Please see this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/shalvamist/784e277b9f679d040bd6be90660a2ff3/model_load_issue_13912.ipynb)\r\nI think I might be running the model with incorrect inputs or there might be an issue with the model itself. Can you please share a way to reproduce the issue you reported ?\r\n\r\nThanks",
