I have another project - project B - that references project A.  Unless onnxtruntime is explicitly added as a Nuget package to project B, onnxtruntime.dll doesn't get copied into the bin folder.  I think this is a property of Nuget more generally, and not onnxruntime per se.",

        "body": "@devnet123 I get the same error on both 1.5.1 and 1.52 versions but I have fixed it.\r\n\r\nHere is how I fixed it:\r\nGo to here: [download onnxruntime.dll from github](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.5.1)\r\nI downloaded the **onnxruntime-win-x64-1.5.1.zip** package since it matches my OS and architecture.\r\n\r\nThen once you have that downloaded, unzip it and go to: **onnxruntime-win-x64-1.5.1\\lib\\**\r\nYou should see the **onnxruntime.dll** inside there.. just leave it for now..\r\nKeep that directory open and then go to back to your project.\r\nGo to the directory (assuming your using **.netcore** and **x64**): **bin\\x64\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\runtimes\\win-x64\\native\\**\r\nWhat matter is you go to the **native** folder.\r\nCopy the **onnxruntime.dll** into that native folder which might have _LdaNative.dll_ and _tensorflow.dll_ also in it (mine does for my setup).\r\nNow when you run your program you should be able to find that dll (module) the application was complaining about.\r\n\r\nI hope that fixes your problem!\r\n",

I think your best bet might be to download the source code from [Microsoft.ML source code](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/releases) and try to build your desired x86 libs. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind not all functionalities when running x86 are supported, specifically TensorFlow and LightGBM. This is stated in the [github for ML](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning#operating-systems-and-processor-architectures-supported-by-mlnet). Another reference to x86 not being supported [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ml-net-0-7-machine-learning-net/). Who knows what issues might arise when trying to build the lib with your setup so I would suggest migrating your project to x64 if possible.",
