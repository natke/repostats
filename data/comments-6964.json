        "body": "As I explore this a bit more, I wonder if the problem isn't only the documentation, but also that the C/C++ APIs aren't as feature rich as I had hoped. For example, one can use the APIs to access the model meta data (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_cxx_api.h#L369), which is culled from here (I guess): https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/core/graph/model.cc#L249-L251, but there is no API method to access the graph itself (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/core/graph/model.cc#L253-L255).\r\n\r\nI for one would like to be able to not only run a model, but also display it. I would also like to be able to hack inside of the Session::Run method so that I could do tricks like the Deep Dream thing. More importantly, in order to convince myself that things are working properly, I want to look at the tensor at the inputs and outputs of internal layers to compare results of models run on different platforms and using different providers. I don't see any way to access this stuff with the current API. If this is something that is on the roadmap, I might be able to put some effort into exposing these functions through the API. If there is some intentional reason _not_ to expose the internals of the model, I am most interested as to why not.",
