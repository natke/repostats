It seems to depend on the model (also updated my initial message with the details).\r\n\r\nI am able to reproduce the segmentation fault with this [CenterFace](https://github.com/Star-Clouds/CenterFace) ONNX model (I downloaded [this](https://github.com/Star-Clouds/CenterFace/blob/master/models/onnx/centerface.onnx) file). In contrast, with [Tiny YOLOv2](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny-yolov2) ONNX model, there is no segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nI deliberately chose detection models since I am facing this with a detection model.\r\n\r\nIs there any more information I can provide which may be useful?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi @yuslepukhin, I couldn't find documentation on `synchronize_inputs()`. How can one tell if `synchronize_inputs()` should be used? (I asked you the same question in another issue. Feel free to answer in a single place and I'll update my other message to avoid duplication).",

For CUDA GPU it means a call to `cudaSynchronize()`. You use it to ensure that the content of the memory you are binding as inputs finished copying the device before inference. And for outputs, you want all of the CUDA operations to finish before reading the bound outputs. If you see that you are getting wrong or inconsistent results, you may try calling it.\r\n\r\n[Here ](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.synchronize.html)is how Pytorch docs put it.\r\n",
