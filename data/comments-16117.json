I will talk to the devs in @onnxruntime-mlas team , I suggest adding an initialize function to mlas so that I can call it in Environment::Initialize()  function. And the initialization happens after initialize cpuinfo. And the functions in WindowsEnv should return Status instead of use loggers. Callers of the functions can decide when to print out. ",
