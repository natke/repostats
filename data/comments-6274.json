To use any Ort method, the environment must be valid. Add another member, env_ like session_ to your class and have it initialized. \r\n\r\n I think when you pass in 630, it is not a valid shape and it is trying to use the default logger to log this event and since the env is not valid, it crashes because the default logger is null.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Keep env valid until the last usage of Ort is done.
