The EP's are in priority order, and so ORT will try to assign a node to the DML EP first if the DML EP is added first (assuming there is a registration for it). Note, the CPU EP is *implicitly* anyway added even if you don't explicitly add it (after the DML EP).\r\n- Were you able to see which nodes are assigned to the CPU EP if you run with ORT_LOGGING_LEVEL_VERBOSE?",
