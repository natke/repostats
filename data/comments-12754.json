But in any case, I would think encountering this in a real-world model will be very rare. Usually, BatchNorms are found in image models and the input shape format that these models tend to have will have N, C pre-pended to the data dimension as these models also generally use Conv which (I think) necessarily needs the N, C dims pre-pended.\r\n\r\nAre you encountering this in a real-world model or is this is a theoretical use-case that you found while testing ORT ?
