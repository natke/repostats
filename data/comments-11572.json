        "body": "@jywu-msft @skottmckay Thank you so much for your input! I was able to resolve the issue with the information that you guys provided.\r\n\r\nCalling `OrtEnv.Instance()` allowed me to bypass the issue of initializing the environment with the default logger and then initializing the `InferenceSession` threw another exception about failing to load \"onnxruntime_providers_tensorrt.dll\" library. However, it pointed to the DLL that resides in \"bin\\Debug\\net6.0\\runtimes\\win-x64\\native\" path instead of the DLL in the  application output directory \"bin\\Debug\\net6.0\". Copying TensorRT DLLs to the former path solved the issue and now everything works fine as intended.\r\n\r\n.NET framework doesn't have the same output directory structure as .NET 6 so it had everything thrown together into the \"bin/Debug\" output directory and it seems this is why I didn't have this issue there. \r\n\r\nAgain, thank you both for your help. Issue is now resolved!",
