The C# DenseTensor class in ORT is a spin-off from System.Numerics.Tensors. Please check the functionalities exposed in that package and see if it meets your needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "It would be extremely helpful if they were exposed. Not all neural networks are trivial. What brought me to this issue is that I am using this runtime to execute a network that requires significant postprocessing of the output doing several common transforms and I'm forced to deep copy data out of the tensor to do this. My 2 cents.",
