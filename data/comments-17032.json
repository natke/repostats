IOBinding support doesn't have a timeline beyond it being the next thing I'm going to work on, I'm starting discussions with some people in Nvidia and the Java group here in Oracle about how to best access GPU pointers and GPU memory from Java, but we haven't got anything implemented in ORT yet. I would prefer a solution that doesn't require any JNI which needs the CUDA (or AMD) headers to compile as it will make the build process for ORT even more complicated than it currently is.",
