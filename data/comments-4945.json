I think what happened was that I had previously done a test build from following the baseline CPU build instructions at https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/BUILD.md#windows , which caused a RelWithDebInfo  to be created.  When I started over, it was no longer there.  \r\n\r\nI compared the two command line strings and just tried removing the --build flag, which seems to have worked.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I then got a message that my version of openvino was unsupported.  When I dug into this further, it turns out that CMakeLists.txt references an environment variable called INTEL_OPENVINO_DIR, which isn't set anywhere.  I set it to my openvino path, and it seems to have gotten a lot further.  It returned with a nonzero exit status.

I am running into different issues trying to get the building working with Openvino on windows and therefore am not able to reproduce the issue you are seeing. \r\n\r\nBuilding nuget packages should work on Windows as long as the onnxruntime native build is successful and you have the prereqs (dotnet and nuget) installed on you machine. If onnxruntime native build is successful then the build script will do nuget restore and other necessary steps required to build nuget package.\r\n\r\nI would suggest you to start from a clean enlistment and try building nuget package for onnxruntime cpu provider first.",
