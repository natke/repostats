        "body": "Well, actually it is an FPGA, and it does not \"run\" C/C++, but we have a High-Level synthesis tool in the middle to translate it into Verilog/VHDL.\r\n\r\nProjects like this [https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/] parse the ONNX graph directly, but then they have to re-implement operations in C from scratch, and this means they only support a very limited range of operators. Since onnxruntime already supports most (all?) ONNX operators and I have seen a library of C++ operators in core/providers/cpu, I was wondering if at some point before the execution a complete C++ representation of the graph exists.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for not being completely honest in my first message. I was trying to get to my point from a different perspective, since in the past starting discussions from the hardware point of view did not get me the answers I needed.) ",
