        "body": "@ivanst0 added the bulk of the new behavior in https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/6436 however that PR seemed to be more about handling multiple CUDA versions being on a machine. \r\n\r\nI included the additional CUDNN_HOME check to be consistent with what the ORT build uses for an explicitly specified path to the CUDNN libraries (and part of the build uses the python bindings for tests). Previously the CUDNN documentation involved putting the binaries in a separate location to CUDA_HOME, but now that that has changed we could remove the usage of CUDNN_HOME from the build etc. That seems like a side issue though. \r\n\r\nIs it that there's a requirement for a user to install CUDA/CUDNN, or that `os.environ` needs to have an entry saying where to find the CUDA dlls? If it's the latter, short term could that entry be added prior to importing the onnxruntime python module, pointing to wherever the CUDA dlls you want to be loaded are? \r\n\r\nLong term, would it be valid to not fail if the CUDA environment variables aren't found (that doesn't mean the dlls aren't available), and do a check via `ctypes.util.find_library` instead after any calls to os.add_dll_directory (if any) are made? i.e. add the CUDA paths we look for using add_dll_directory if found, but also allow for a user having added path information. \r\n ",

        "body": "> ok I will check.\r\n> \r\n> There is other issue .\r\n> \r\n> same model produces different result with `onnxruntime-gpu==1.12.1` and `onnxruntime-gpu==1.11.0`. New version produces buggy inference.\r\n> \r\n> Every new release you introduce new bugs !! so tired.\r\n\r\nI understand your frustration about bugs. Unfortunately, bugs will come with new features and changes. We will try our best to do better testing and avoid regressions. You can help us by opting into our Release Candidate testing. Every release we will have a couple weeks period where we publish Release Candidates and users can report issues before we finalize the release.\r\ne.g. see https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/12133\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCan you please file a separate issue with repro steps and assets for the \"buggy inference\" issue? Otherwise it is getting buried in this closed issue and others aren't looking at it.\r\nIt's difficult to say whether there is an ORT regression at this point. (I think you also updated CUDA version, right?)\r\nWhich execution provider do you use? CUDAExecutionProvider? Does the issue occur with CPUExecutionProvider ? ",
