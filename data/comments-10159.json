        "body": "Another issue I noticed (which might be more concerning than the original issue to us) is, although we get the speedup most of the time with the Tensorrt provider, there are a few cases where the inference time can dramatically increase.\r\n\r\nHere are my inference time results on a  ~2500 sentence test set  using the same code -- the first one takes around 3,900,000ms, the 2nd/3rd/4th/5th  all takes > 100,000ms. Starting from the 6th sentences, the time begins to be around 100-200ms, but the inference time occasionally increases to > 100,000ms for the following sentences: 13, 14, 15, 79, 141, 258, 1557, 1652, 2160. It doesn't seem to be directly related to the sentence length, as the words in the sentences are 187,41,42,37,257,250,186,37,34(some of them is not particularly long). Generally the sentences in the test set are 30-250 words long.\r\n\r\nI wonder what might be causing this occasional increase of inference time? Is it a TensorRT re-warmup? Is it likely a TensorRT issue or OnnxRuntime issue?\r\n",
