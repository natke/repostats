        "body": "Hi @RandySheriffH, I will try to get one up here for you in the next couple weeks. I ended up just forking the repo and implementing my operator directly into onnxruntime, following the recent implementation of grid_sample as an example.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the first crash that stopped me had to do with the custom op not being registered with the `IMLOperatorRegistry` for DML. It seems like this happens automatically w/ a CUDA or CPU custom operator, but maybe that step is skipped with the DML custom operator.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that there's also another piece missing in the current API, which is that the D3D12 command buffer and buffer resources need to somehow be made available to the custom operator when the `Compute` function is called.",
