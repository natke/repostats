You just need to serve your actual html page with these two headers:\r\n```\r\nCross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp\r\nCross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin\r\n```\r\nSo for example in express.js it would look something like this:\r\n```js\r\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\r\n  res.set(\"Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy\", \"require-corp\");\r\n  res.set(\"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy\", \"same-origin\");\r\n  res.sendFile(\"./index.html\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\nYou can check if it's working by seeing the result of `self.crossOriginIsolated` in your browser console. It should be `true` if you want to use wasm threads.",
