        "body": "@FRIEDparrot, is your intention to use `torch_ort_infer` to accelerate an inferene scenario or use `torch_ort` and `onnxruntime-training` to accelerate a training scenario? `onnxruntime-training` is only distributed for linux (not for windows) at the moment. Which is why you're probably not able to install it on your windows machine.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to install for Windows, I would suggest trying to build `onnxruntime-training` from source (I can provide the necessary steps if needed) and then install it. And then try using `torch_ort_infer` with this. I must caution you that we have not performed extensive testing for Windows+onnxruntime-training though.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, we might in the near future start publishing a Windows package for `onnxruntime-training`, but I don't have any timelines that I can share with you right now.",

        "body": "> ### Describe the issue\r\n> I installed the torch_ort and try to use this package to accelerate the model training process on my PC (I have no NAVDIA GPU hence I can only install

#### 3. If you want to pip install torch_ort, it would failed with no onnxruntime.training model\r\n> to check if the pytorch is successfully, use `python -m torch_ort.configure` in command line, and try 'import torch_ort'\r\n> \r\n> ### Urgency\r\n> _No response_\r\n> \r\n> ### ONNX Runtime Installation\r\n> Built from Source\r\n> \r\n> ### ONNX Runtime Version or Commit ID\r\n> 1.13.1\r\n> \r\n> ### PyTorch Version\r\n> 1.12.0\r\n> \r\n> ### Execution Provider\r\n> Default CPU\r\n> \r\n> ### Execution Provider Library Version\r\n> _No response_\r\n\r\nHave you find a solution ?
