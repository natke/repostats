Basically we have at any time only one input along a sequence, calculate the prediction but need to have the LSTM layers keep their internal state to predict the next input. We cannot wait to get the full sequence since we are working in a streaming environment. \r\n\r\nResults are very different, its not only precision from floating point operations.\r\n\r\nI will post a test case here soon.
