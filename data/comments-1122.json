        "body": "Hi, I haven't encountered actual use cases that required unsupported data types, I was just expanding our application's test cases to cover some custom models and noticed some data types are unsupported.\r\n\r\nThat being said, our application allows users to provide their own Onnx models which may come with various operators and types. That is why I wish there is a build option to build the library with Onnx support that matches the version matrix. Perhaps if that build option is not set, the library will be built with minimized setting to meet the balance between size and breadth of support as you mentioned.\r\n\r\nI understand that it will be a long process to add such build option (or other equivalent), so at the meantime, it will be helpful if there is a table about what types in operators are currently disabled in Onnx Runtime. So that in the case similar to #1080, I can refer to the table and know if the error is due to incorrect usage of the APIs.",
