        "body": "Hi @snnn, thanks for your help on both this thread and the one you posted earlier. I've met the same error and am \r\n investigating with windbg. \r\n\r\nWindbg could run my test script but there seems not to be any related lines about \"LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL\" in the [log](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/files/9976195/windbg_log.txt). At the same time, windbg's python output still throws the same error:\r\n```\r\n2022-11-09 16:22:50.5725246 [E:onnxruntime:Default, provider_bridge_ort.cc:1269 onnxruntime::TryGetProviderInfo_CUDA] C:\\Users\\user\\projects\\onnxruntime.cuda\\onnxruntime\\core\\session\\provider_bridge_ort.cc:1072 onnxruntime::ProviderLibrary::Get [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : LoadLibrary failed with error 126 \"\" when trying to load \"C:\\Users\\user\\projects\\test\\env\\lib\\site-packages\\onnxruntime\\capi\\onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll\"\r\n\r\n2022-11-09 16:22:50.5811151 [W:onnxruntime:Default, onnxruntime_pybind_state.cc:579 onnxruntime::python::CreateExecutionProviderInstance] Failed to create CUDAExecutionProvider. Please reference https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/reference/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements to ensure all dependencies are met.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also used the dependency walker to identify the onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll dependencies (screenshot attached). It seems able to locate all the other dlls.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on where I did wrongly? Thanks a lot\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8852730/200970760-265a429d-a1d1-4a0d-8f3d-3ad1530aa382.png)\r\n",
