        "body": "I was thinking we already had `update_in_place` that took an `OrtValue` but apparently not. Another idea is to have an OrtValue creation interface that took buffer pointer, shape, and type, and device info and add `update_in_place` that takes an `OrtValue`. With `OrtValue.update_inplace_from_buffer(source_ptr, bytes)`, we need to pass in source device info (some metadata that is available in an `OrtValue` instance) and it seems incomplete to not have an interface that supported creating `OrtValue` using a raw buffer in the first place (something that C/C++ API does)",
