We are also tracking the previous issues that you created (like to support ES6 module and web worker) in backlogs.\r\n\r\na big benefit of WebGPU is the compute shader, which is expected to be more efficient compared to the WebGL standard graphics rendering pipeline (vertex + frag shader). However, this also means the shaders need to be rewritten.\r\n\r\nI have a [branch](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/fs-eire/webgpu-poc) (ongoing) for a prototype of webgpu backend. trying to support a few models soon.",
