        "body": "Hard to say without seeing the model. \r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that ORT does not split up a batch internally, so you may get better performance by doing that yourself and making concurrent requests to Run, if that is possible with your model. By 'split up' I mean that if ORT received a batch of 4 items, it doesn't take each item (or say 2 items at a time) and run it separately through the graph in parallel.   \r\n\r\ne.g. say you have 4 cores. you could send in 4 concurrent requests to Run, each with a batch size of 128. you may also want to set intra-op threadpool size to 1 so that the concurrent requests aren't attempting to use more threads than there are cores (only necessary if some of the nodes are assigned to CPU though). \r\n\r\n",
