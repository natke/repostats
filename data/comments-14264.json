        "body": "@snnn Thanks for the quick reply on that. Notice that there are two different compiler errors in the above build log. The linked PR fixes only one of them. The other one complains that `OrtValue` is an incomplete type in [this line](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/onnxruntime/core/framework/session_options.h#L131).\r\n\r\nI tried with commit 82d123b6c91845c7363981963ae3ba0843c5c4a5 as well as with the very recent commit cc7799835e9840d61e0ff16823b20e2be9186955. Building without abseil fails with both of them. With the latter, some additional errors show up (there might be even more if the build didn't stop after these):\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/jf99/build/my-onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/framework/allocation_planner.cc:1013:10: error: ‘deque’ is not a member of ‘std’\r\n 1013 |     std::deque<NodeIndex> que;\r\n      |          ^~~~~\r\n/home/jf99/build/my-onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/framework/allocation_planner.cc:28:1: note: ‘std::deque’ is defined in header ‘<deque>’; did you forget to ‘#include <deque>’?\r\n   27 | #include \"nlohmann/json.hpp\"\r\n  +++ |+#include <deque>\r\n   28 | using json = nlohmann::json;\r\n/home/jf99/build/my-onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/framework/allocation_planner.cc:1013:25: error: expected primary-expression before ‘>’ token\r\n 1013 |     std::deque<NodeIndex> que;\r\n      |                         ^\r\n/home/jf99/build/my-onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/framework/allocation_planner.cc:1013:27: error: ‘que’ was not declared in this scope\r\n 1013 |     std::deque<NodeIndex> que;\r\n      |                           ^~~\r\n```",
