Need to see how that is called, how the session is run, and what other dependencies the code has. \r\n\r\nIs the crash from attempting to load an MKL library? The error mentions dlopen and libmklml.dylib. Not sure where that dependency would come from as afaik the ORT package doesn't include or use that. ",
