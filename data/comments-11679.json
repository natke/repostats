        "body": "@fs-eire Ah I see. It looks like [latest MacOS Safari has thread support](https://web.dev/webassembly-feature-detection/), and the issue you linked was using latest Safari version, and in my testing MacOS Safari works fine, so I'm not too sure what's going on there. It is specifically iOS browsers (i.e. iOS WebKit) that don't work for me.\r\n\r\nI've just tried using these support checks from [this web.dev article](https://web.dev/webassembly-feature-detection/#loading-the-correct-bundle) and iOS WebKit apparently has support for everything except tail call and simd:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst bigInt = () => (async e => { try { return (await WebAssembly.instantiate(e)).instance.exports.b(BigInt(0)) === BigInt(0); } catch (e) { return !1; } })(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 1, 96, 1, 126, 1, 126, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 5, 1, 1, 98, 0, 0, 10, 6, 1, 4, 0, 32, 0, 11]));\r\nconst bulkMemory = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 3, 1, 0, 1, 10, 14, 1, 12, 0, 65, 0, 65, 0, 65, 0, 252, 10, 0, 0, 11]));\r\nconst exceptions = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 8, 1, 6, 0, 6, 64, 25, 11, 11]));\r\nconst multiValue = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 1, 96, 0, 2, 127, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 8, 1, 6, 0, 65, 0, 65, 0, 11]));\r\nconst mutableGlobals = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 1, 97, 1, 98, 3, 127, 1, 6, 6, 1, 127, 1, 65, 0, 11, 7, 5, 1, 1, 97, 3, 1]));\r\nconst referenceTypes = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 7, 1, 5, 0, 208, 112, 26, 11]));\r\nconst saturatedFloatToInt = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 12, 1, 10, 0, 67, 0, 0, 0, 0, 252, 0, 26, 11]));\r\nconst signExtensions = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 8, 1, 6, 0, 65, 0, 192, 26, 11]));\r\nconst simd = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 123, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 10, 1, 8, 0, 65, 0, 253, 15, 253, 98, 11]));\r\nconst tailCall = async () => WebAssembly.validate(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 10, 6, 1, 4, 0, 18, 0, 11]));\r\nconst threads = () => (async e => { try { return \"undefined\" != typeof MessageChannel && new MessageChannel().port1.postMessage(new SharedArrayBuffer(1)), WebAssembly.validate(e); } catch (e) { return !1; } })(new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 96, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 10, 11, 1, 9, 0, 65, 0, 254, 16, 2, 0, 26, 11]));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if those support checks are doing their job correctly, then it seems that this issue isn't to do with threads. That said, setting `ort.env.wasm.numThreads = 1` does indeed fix the issue, so maybe the above threads support check is incomplete/wrong?\r\n\r\nFor now I've added a check for `simd` support and set `numThreads=1` if there is no support. This works for now, but perhaps only by accident ðŸ¤”",
