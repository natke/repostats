This means that a potential solution would be to ship the onxxruntime as a framework instead.\r\n\r\nAnother potential solution would be to include the fact that the onxxruntime static library needs to link with CoreML by enabling auto linking when building the static library (see https://www.smileykeith.com/2022/02/23/lc-linker-option/ for more information about auto linking). Seems like it builds down to passing `-fmodules` to clang when building the static library (note that the other options mentioned in that article, such as passing --linker-option=... to clang, don't work because of clang limitations, as I found out [here](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/15118#issuecomment-1141181708)).\r\n\r\n",
