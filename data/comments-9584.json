Assuming I can pre-determine the dimensions (tricky for my application, but probably doable): can you give me a hint how the allocation would work for the DML EP? As in: a code snippet that shows how to (without using CreateTensor() whose overloads would all seem to require a MemoryInfo) create a Value that I can feed to BindInput()/ BindOutput()? ",
