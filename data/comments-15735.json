I think running multiple inferences in parallel can be either slower or faster depending on the workload? I can't figure out how to have sessions have an affinity for which worker they execute on though.\r\n\r\nIt's not like there's any documentation on this anywhere... I don't know what it going on or whether this feature is already implemented or how I can get it under control in order to utilize my CPU to its fullest potential or whether ORT is already doing that or something.",
