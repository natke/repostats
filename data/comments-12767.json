        "body": "@AXKuhta: 1D inputs should work and broadcast to 2D implicitly, but I'm glad you were able to easily work around it by reshaping. The bug is in the ORT EP DmlOperatorMatMul.cpp, which calls `MatMulShapeMapping` but then calls the generic `CreateTensorDescFromInput` helper to broadcast strides, and MatMul has special rules to follow which the generic broadcasting doesn't handle. Surprisingly it's been this way 4 years without an earlier report (thanks), but we should fix it for 1.4.",
