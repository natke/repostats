We're all developers here, but please, _realize that this dialog is scary as hell for the average user_\r\n\r\nConsider the installer experience as a \"product unboxing\" ... there's nice product packaging that care about product unboxing, and there's ugly products that make unboxing a pain.  Installer experiences should run as seamless and smooth as possible so they provide a good user experience.  Hammering the user with redundant dialogs is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That's why some of the solutions provided here don't apply.",
