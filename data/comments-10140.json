The problem is, we didn't expect users (webapp developers who consume onnxruntime-web) to run bundlers on source code of onnxruntime-web.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-web-demo/issues/15, Vite actually run into scan file 'onnxruntime-web/lib/wasm/proxy-wrapper.js'. This is not what I expected; my expectation is the bundler picks up the single file 'dist/ort-web.min.js' directly, skipping the building phrase and ignores anything under folder 'onnxruntime-web/lib'.\r\n\r\n[the \"browser\" field](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/js/web/package.json#L3)",
