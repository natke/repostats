Please let me know if theres an solution, I've been banging my head against a wall all day.\r\n\r\nOkay quick update. I was able to get it running after copying all the binaries from:\r\n- CUDA (Version 11.2)\r\n- cudNN (Version 11 --> Binary version: 8.9.1.23)\r\n(+ the zlib dll) \r\n\r\ninto the directory where all my project's binaries are (in my case, the debug folder).\r\n\r\nI tested a bit further and it turns out its really just an issue with the PATH environment variable. \r\n\r\nFor the ones that are still struggeling, you can try the following:\r\n- Install CUDA --> https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads\r\n- Download CudNN binaries --> https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download\r\n- Download zlibwapi.dll --> http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib123dllx64.zip\r\n- Add the bin folder of the CUDA installation to your PATH environment variable\r\n- Copy the CudNN binaries into a folder and add that folder to the PATH environment variable.\r\n- Add zlibwapi to your project (so it gets copied) or add it into a folder and add that folder to the PATH environment variable\r\n- **Restart all Terminals & Visual Studio** (This is important because without restarting all terminals it seems that the PATH changes don't get applied)\r\n\r\nIf you want to share your software with others, you will have to add the following binaries to your project so they get copied:\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/assets/54699751/45300cb5-2f72-45e5-832b-8f5e8797cec1)\r\n\r\nHope this helps somewhat :)",
