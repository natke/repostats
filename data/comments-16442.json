It's quite a problem with AMD cards at present under linux for any ML work, but the price of NVIDIA cards these days as I'm sure you know!\r\n\r\nSo I've been following the guide at the bottom of this thread: https://github.com/yangxy/GPEN/issues/120\r\n\r\nI even made a comment asking if this was for windows, but then _I saw against the package on PyPi that onnxruntime-directml does support Posix Linux_.  So you're saying that it does, but only under WSL?\r\n\r\nIs this likely to ever change?  I guess the guide I was following was for windows, or the package mention was a mistake.  I'm leaning toward it was a mistake as I don't think it runs on windows.  Thanks.\r\n",

It's something we've considered before, and although we don't have time right now, if you have the penchant to fork it and attempt, it *should* work ü§û.",
