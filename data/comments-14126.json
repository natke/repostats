        "body": "\r\n\r\n\r\n> Hi @TedThemistokleous, Could you please tell us how you test MIGraphX and ORT on your side?\r\n\r\n@PeixuanZuo, so typically we build from the top of the ORT mainline tree for new additions and features, as were the changes created and tested with PR #12899 (Stream sync changes). There were a few other changes floating around which would run an entire test run with both MIGraphX and ORT to run some models.\r\n\r\nDuring testing I had a few models we tested with using some of the bench marking scripts in the ORT repo. \r\n\r\nWe have some additional scripts which do a performance run using ORT+MIGraphx that's run monthly internally for our own metrics. That's what triggered me digging into this build failure and uncovering things.\r\n\r\nWe have CI (Jenkins+github actions) automation setup  which does a test build with ORT for every one of our pull requests targeting a SHA-1 from ORT mainline.\r\n\r\nAs I've began looking into this, we're using an older SHA-1 (Back from 2021) to test all our builds in CI , which I'm currently fixing. I'm rolling back from ORT main, until I find a working SHA-1 which  I shall fix any MIGraphX issues on our side sync with ORT mainline: https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/AMDMIGraphX/pull/1504. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's a preferred set of git tags or release branches instead we should just be building and testing against, instead of using main.\r\n\r\nIn our case we want to get our Docker to be a working out of the box solution which gives a tested and working version of ORT and MIGraphx to the user as well so they can build the MIGraphX EP via the build_and_test_onnxrt.sh found in our repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I check the branch migraphx_for_ort and this branch was maintained by someone but stopped updating since Apr 12, 2022. Do you know why MIGraphX provide this branch for ORT before? Is there any special changes for ORT? I think the first PR which specified branch migraphx_for_ort is https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/2929/files#diff-2461bc0718da8a72e86fbe9f8023ec0f8eae563bebf8e44fef223e39c3bd96e0R30. Thanks.\r\n\r\nSo there's some history here. The developer who maintained this branch moved on and why its been without a maintainer until I joined in June 2022. We were pushing performance updates to this branch as a way to get changes into your CI process with the latest MIGraphX changes, but these changes would later be integrated into MIGraphX's mainline and releases. \r\n\r\nCurrently the latest and greatest should be added via ROCm releases at this point as we're run all our CI and QA checks through these changes.",
