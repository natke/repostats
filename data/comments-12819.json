With setting from user like pasted above, ort will create the number of threads **without** setting affinity. For some models where ops internal computing logics are not parallelized, indeed you will see only the main thread is doing all the work.",

        "body": "Can you share the model and how you're measuring performance? \r\n\r\nAs Randy mentioned whether multiple cores are used or not is dependent on both the operators involved and amount of work they have to do. It is possible that an operator is parallelizing something when you have 8 threads and the overhead of that parallelization costs more than the benefit leading to worse performance compared to having one thread.
