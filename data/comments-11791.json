        "body": "Then I think we should stop publishing packages to test pypi to ease the confusion. \r\n\r\nFrom security & compliance perspective, without doubt pypi.org is a good place for hosting packages for open source projects like onnxruntime. The others, like testpypi or Azure Devops, need evaluation. This is very different than Microsoft 1st-party usages. A non-opensource project can create a private Azure Devops feed to host all python package they need there. They can  create a daily pipeline to build onnxruntime from source and publish onnxruntime nightly package to their private Azure devops feed. They can also do the same thing for their software. It is under a condition that the feed is private, which means the onnxruntime nightly package is also private. Because if the feed is public, they will need to evaluate if they can redistribute onnxruntime's dependent packages. Generally speaking, from copyright perspective the answer is no. If we have a feed that only contains onnxruntime python package without the dependent packages that we don't own, then it may suffer supply chain attack. For example, we publish nuget packages to https://aiinfra.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_artifacts/feed/ORT-Nightly, but I can't recommend anyone to use it. Most of the packages only have zero downloads. And I can't publish these nuget packages to nuget.org, because nuget.org's policy doesn't allow so. \r\nSo, if any of you need a nightly package, I can only recommend building onnxruntime from source by yourself.  You can setup a nightly pipeline and publish the package to any non-public place. ",
