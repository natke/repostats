From what I understand in the link you sent, the command will only be executed if NumPy is asked as a Python Component in the `find_package` call, which is only possible from CMake 3.14. Surely tests would be needed to ensure compatibility with the `onnxruntime_python.cmake` file at least.\r\n\r\nI don't often contribute but if there are facilities to help testing all scenario you might face I would be happy to help. Is there some kind of automatic CI Builds / Tests / Profilings... even for external contributors? ",
