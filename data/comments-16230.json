The default location for OpenJDK in Homebrew is `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/`, so try setting it to that.\r\n\r\nRunning `./build.sh --update --build --build_java --config Release --parallel --use_coreml` on an M1 laptop with macOS 13.4 on a clean checkout of `v1.15.0` still gives me an error when adding CoreML and it looks like it's because the name of the native flag changed. If you modify line 603 of [this file](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/java/src/main/native/ai_onnxruntime_OrtSession_SessionOptions.c#L603) to say `#ifdef USE_COREML`, note there is only one underscore, then you should get a CoreML compatible jar file. I'll put in a PR with the fix.",

Given there are already binaries available in the jar file, I think it will be a good idea - a lot of people will be running into build issues otherwise.\r\n",

For homebrew JDKs I have `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home` which looks like it's got the right things in it. The CMake detection wants to find the libraries to make sure it's got it, and the other folder doesn't have a `lib`.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there are plans to include CoreML in the Maven package, the binary is already pretty large and it would complicate the packaging (as I think you'd need to build on a specific version of macOS).

I used the `--config Debug` hoping it would create `.dylib` with debug symbols but when I run `find ./build/MacOS/Debug -name '*.dylib' | xargs dsymutil` I see no results. This implies that some `cmake` level config needs to set for the debug symbols to be available. \r\n\r\nI haven't done C/C++ development in decades so if anyone can chime in, I am happy to build the library and upload it somewhere for debugging.
