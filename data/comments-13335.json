        "body": "First, in the main branch we change it back to 3.18.3. \r\n\r\nSecond, because the dev team of protobuf says 3.18.x is out of maintenance, I will follow @djee-ms's suggestion to update the version to 3.20.x. Also, I'm converting the protobuf submodule to a cmake external project, which will allow users to choose between the protobuf we provide and the one that is already installed in their environment. So, as long as ORT's source code is compatible to that protobuf version, you will be able to freely change it. And if there was build errors, for example the ones we have now for 3.20.x, welcome to submit your patches. ",
