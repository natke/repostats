We have leverage such transformer optimizer.\r\n\r\nCan we say that ORT would measure same performance for dynamic and static shape for all models besides Bert? Such as detection and image super resolution models, which would request dynamic shape support.\r\n\r\nIf yes, then can you help me understand how ORT solve such dynamic shape support? Such as memory allocation, kernel caching, etc. ",
