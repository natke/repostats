        "body": "~~As an additional point, a question I asked [previously](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/3706) seems to indicate that currently the only C++ API in terms of training is taking an existing inference onnx model and augmenting it for training:~~\r\n\r\n>If you already have an ONNX model. there is an example too (which also uses ORTTrainer). However in this case the ONNX model needs to output loss as well). Please be noted that this approach is only used for testing purpose for now. We will see if there are strong need to really support this use case.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not sure what OP's use case is, our use-case is performing training on embedded/edge devices where we cannot use Python. For this purpose, it would be nice if there was a way to serialize a training model from PyTorch and load this into ORT training.\r\n\r\nEdit: The C++ bindings for ort training are indeed full featured as evidenced by the sample trainers that call into it directly. The PyTorch is just a thin wrapper around it that first converts a pytorch model to an onnx model before using the c++ training core.",
