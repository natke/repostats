        "body": "The logic of converting an image to a tensor would be specific to the model that the tensor is being fed into. For example, https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/mask-rcnn#preprocessing-steps describes the image pre-processing steps for the Mask RCNN and hence there is no \"generic\" logic for conversion and would have to depend on the model itself (how the model was trained). Hope this helps.",
