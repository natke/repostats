        "body": "For anyone wondering on how to workaround on this please follow below steps (might be similar to other operators):\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n2. In file `onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/providers/cpu/nn/conv.cc`\r\nRegister the existing Generic 'Conv' operator for _Double_ type\r\n```C++\r\n...\r\nONNX_CPU_OPERATOR_TYPED_KERNEL(\r\n    Conv,\r\n    11,\r\n    double,\r\n    KernelDefBuilder().TypeConstraint(\"T\", DataTypeImpl::GetTensorType<double>()),\r\n    Conv<double>);\r\n```\r\n3. In file `onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/util/math_cpu.cc`\r\nRegister Im2col function for _Double_ type\r\n```C++\r\n...\r\ntemplate struct Im2col<float, StorageOrder::NCHW>;\r\ntemplate struct Im2col<uint8_t, StorageOrder::NCHW>;\r\ntemplate struct Im2col<double, StorageOrder::NCHW>; //added line\r\n```\r\n4. In file `onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/providers/cpu/cpu_execution_provider.cc`\r\nAdd a class definition and kernel info for operator from step 2\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n...\r\nclass ONNX_OPERATOR_TYPED_KERNEL_CLASS_NAME(kCpuExecutionProvider, kOnnxDomain, 11, double, Conv);\r\n...\r\nBuildKernelCreateInfo<ONNX_OPERATOR_TYPED_KERNEL_CLASS_NAME(kCpuExecutionProvider, kOnnxDomain, 11, double, Conv)>,\r\n```\r\n5. Build the source code using following command: `.\\build.bat --config Release --build_shared_lib --parallel --enable_pybind --skip_tests --build_wheel --update --build --cmake_generator \"Visual Studio 16 2019\"`\r\n     . You have to specify `--cmake_generator \"Visual Studio 16 2019\"` option since it doesn't build with VS 2017 for whatever reason\r\n     . Above command is for python build ONLY. For other builds please check [this ](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build.html) document \r\n6. You can now find the compiled _whl_ in the `onnxruntime/build/Windows/Release/Release/dist` directory. You can install this package in python using pip: `pip install onnxruntime-1.7.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl --force-reinstall`\r\n\r\nI've tried some simple tests on this and they came up okay but I'm not sure if this will cover all convolution cases.\r\nIf you think this solution is valuable to anyone kindly let me know so I can create a pull request.\r\nOtherwise please feel free to close the issue.",
