        "body": "I think you are asking if it is possible to keep the network state between individual inferences so that you can process e.g. time-series data iteratively instead of passing it all at once to onnxruntime. There are some existing discussions on this in the issue tracker if you search for e.g. LSTM. In general, it's not possible to do this with onnxruntime today because each inference in onnxruntime is stateless. One workaround is to include all relevant internal states in the model output and passing them in as additional input again during the next inference. I did something like this in the past for LSTMs and it worked well for my purposes.",

However, when the model goes deep, it becomes a heavy task to maintain all the states. Anyway, thanks for your response. It seems that there are no ideal solutions for this issue.",
