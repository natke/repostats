We can publish our symbols to Microsoft Symbol Servers. In the past, we always did it. But we only published stripped ones(without [private symbols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/public-and-private-symbols) ). We could publish the full version, it's just I didn't have enough time to do it yet.  The PDBs in our release page are not stripped. ",
