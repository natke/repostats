        "body": "Pasting my reply from the internal e-mail thread:\r\n\r\nI suspect Netron doesn’t support cases where-in a graph output is not produced by a node in the graph and that is why while visualizing the optimized graph in Netron, it seems like certain graph outputs are missing from the nested subgraphs. I downloaded both the original and the optimized models you had attached and dumped the subgraphs and studied the graph outputs in the subgraphs using the ONNX API. They were the same in both case. Code snippet-\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport onnx\r\n\r\nmodel_1 = onnx.load(r'dump_1.onnx')\r\ngraph_1 = model_1.graph\r\n\r\nmodel_2 = onnx.load(r'dump_2.onnx')\r\ngraph_2 = model_2.graph\r\n\r\nfor output in graph_1.output:\r\n    print(output.name)\r\n\r\nfor output in graph_2.output:\r\n    print(output.name)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo, this clarifies the first question you raised – the optimized model is still keeping the nested subgraph ONNX compliant (i.e.) the first output of Loop subgraph is still the termination condition. Yes, the Identity gets eliminated in the optimized subgraph, but that doesn’t make the subgraph ONNX non-compliant. \r\n\r\nI suspect with the `If`, the Constant node is converted to an initializer and the initializer is feeding the subgraph output (and again since no node is feeding the subgraph output, Netron doesn’t place the subgraph output in the list of subgraph outputs).\r\n\r\nAs for removing value infos from the list of graph outputs that are not fed from a node output, I don’t find anything in the ONNX IR that states that graph outputs MUST be produced by node outputs (i.e.) it is quite valid for subgraph outputs to be produced by initializers. So, the underlying assumption that \"each graph's output MUST BE some node's output in this graph\" is not part of the ONNX IR.\r\n",
