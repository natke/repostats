        "body": "This is expected as ONNX's GraphProto message doesn't support storing initializers of type `SequenceProto`. It only supports storing `TensorProto` and `SparseTensorProto` initializers currently (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/ee4888c24510787bb8c61ebcba43ef252744e648/onnx/onnx.in.proto#L449). So even if this node can be folded there is currently not a way to store the \"constant\" result as an initializer in the `GraphProto` instance. We would have to find other ways to hold them in the runtime. \r\n\r\nMaybe we can make the message a bit less jarring (i.e.) it doesn't need to be a warning log for sequence types.",

Can you please help me understand the potential performance benefits that we could gain from having constant folding support for sequences? I could bring this up for discussion with the relevant ONNX groups. If you don't see value in it, I guess that making this a log and not a warning for sequence types would make sense. ",
