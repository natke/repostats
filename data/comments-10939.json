        "body": "I believe currently the automated pipelines only validate the python package we build (using 1.21), and there is no automated test coverage for older versions. Relaxing the numpy version would either:\r\na) require adding more automated test pipelines for older version -> not sustainable\r\nb) not add the automated tests, and risk older versions not working -> user issues\r\n\r\nOut of these, it seems like requiring the tested version may be the best option. In general it's good practice to update to newer packages and for numpy, we specifically upgraded to 1.21 due to a security vulnerability in the older version. \r\n\r\nFor tf2onnx:\r\n- for older version of TF that don't support numpy 1.21 -> use older version of ORT, or manually ORT with numpy 1.19\r\n - for newer versions of TF that do support 1.21 -> directly use ORT 1.11 \r\n",
