Indeed, it is __527, I mixed something with the __528 which comes from a different input layer which I did some experiments with to exclude the input size as the root of this problem.\r\n\r\nThe model runs on the CPU without an error, only the CUDA execution fails with the cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration.\r\nRegarding the timeline: At the moment the CPU version is sufficient to test our pipeline. However, runtime is crucial for us, so we have to use to CUDA version as CPU execution time is too high. We have to make runtime benchmarks in the near future to see if our pipeline and our models stay below our maximum execution time. So it's not super urgent for our immediate timeline, but important for the near future.\r\n",
