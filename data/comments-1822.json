All I want to do right now is to load some test sample on that code and score/predict using that .onnx model. The .onnx inference I have, was generated from MNIST data, I want to test some MNIST test data to match the prediction using the c++ api.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDebo.",

How do I do that ?? \r\ne.g. I have a mnist.onnx trained model which takes input of shape 1x28x28 and gives a 1x10 softmax output (handwritten digits) I have loaded this model using c++ api (very similar to this https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/csharp/test/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.EndToEndTests.Capi/C_Api_Sample.cpp) end I have mnist test sample ; now how do I load that test sample and check prediction using onnx runtime c/c++ api.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDebottam.",
