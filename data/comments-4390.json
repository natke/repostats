        "body": "Each session is a standalone entity so there's not much you can do inter-session.\r\n\r\nOn a per-session level you should be able to use the new IOBinding feature to provide the inputs on GPU and potentially keep the outputs on GPU post-execution. Keeping the outputs on GPU requires you to know the size of each output in order to pre-allocate a buffer on GPU with the correct size/shape. \r\n\r\nWe're working on making this simpler as currently pytorch is required to do the allocation on GPU. That change should be available in the next couple of weeks and will remove the pytorch dependency. We will also be adding a mechanism to keep an output on GPU even if you don't know the size prior to model execution. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/test/python/onnxruntime_test_python_iobinding.py has some example IOBinding usage, but possibly isn't clear enough about allocating memory on GPU. \r\n\r\nHere is a minimal example of how you'd currently allocate an output on GPU and bind that to the output 'output_name' from graph execution. When ORT executes the model it will write the output directly to this buffer with no copy to CPU. Similar approach for inputs. \r\n\r\nIn this example the model takes an input X with shape {1, 2} and produces an two outputs, Y (shape {1, 1}) and Z. For the sake of the example we provide the input on CPU, and ask for the Y output to be written to a pre-allocated buffer on GPU, and the Z output to be returned on CPU. Note that if you're using IOBinding you must bind all inputs and outputs. \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport torch\r\nimport onnxruntime as ort\r\n\r\nsess = ort.InferenceSession(\"model.onnx\")\r\nio_binding = sess.io_binding()\r\n\r\n# create input 'X' with shape [1,2]. bind the input to the cpu object. ORT will handle any copy to GPU if needed\r\nx = np.array([1., 2.], np.float32).reshape(1, 2)\r\nio_binding.bind_cpu_input(\"X\", x)\r\n# the bind_cpu_input call is roughly equivalent to \r\n# io_binding.bind_input(\"X\", 'cpu', 0, np.float32, list([1, 2]), x.__array_interface__['data'][0])\r\n\r\n# create buffer for output 'Y' on cuda. \r\nd = torch.device(\"cuda\", 0)\r\ntorch_tensor = torch.zeros([1, 1], device=d, dtype=torch.float32)\r\nio_binding.bind_output(\"Y\", torch_tensor.device.type, torch_tensor.device.index, np.float32, [1,1], torch_tensor.data_ptr())\r\n\r\n# receive output Z on CPU (no preallocated buffer)\r\nio_binding.bind_output(\"Z\")\r\n\r\nsess.run_with_iobinding(io_binding)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput from `help(io_binding)`\r\n\r\n> class IOBinding(builtins.object)\r\n |  IOBinding(session)\r\n |  \r\n |  This class provides API to bind input/output to a specified device, e.g. GPU.\r\n |  \r\n |  Methods defined here:\r\n |  \r\n |  __init__(self, session)\r\n |      Initialize self.
