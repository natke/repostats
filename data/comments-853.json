Can you tell me how to NuGet onnx runtime ( is it the same way with load onnxruntime by NuGet in C#. I just choose project properties and choose to manage NuGet packages). Furthermore, the onnxruntime_cxx_api.h need to include the onnxruntime_c_api.h, so if you do not include onnxruntime_c_api.h, how it can be combined?",
