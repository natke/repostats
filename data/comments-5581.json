        "body": "Usually such errors point to a model conversion error. What this error means is that there is a node that should have inputs of type T (homogeneous), for example: inputs all of type float or all of type double. In your case, there are inputs of type T: atleast one of which are float and one of which are double. It is is hard to say which node is problematic without the model.  Can you share this data with the project that helped you obtain the ONNX model ? They should be able to help. See very similar discussion here: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/1764\r\n\r\nAs an aside: any reason you are forced to still use the 0.4.0 version of ONNXRuntime ?\r\n\r\n",
