        "body": "> The type initializer for 'Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.NativeMethods' threw an exception.\r\n---> System.DllNotFoundException: onnxruntime\r\n\r\nThe onnxruntime.dll from the Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime nuget package doesn't appear to be in a location where it can be loaded.\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed nuget package contains the ONNX Runtime C# bindings and calls the native code in onnxruntime.dll. The namespace in Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed is also called Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime which makes things slightly confusing. \r\n\r\nThe error is coming from the C# bindings class [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.NativeMethods](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/csharp/src/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/NativeMethods.shared.cs) when it tries to setup the infrastructure to call the native code. This involves onnxruntime.dll needing to be loaded by the .net infrastructure.\r\n\r\nNot familiar with how a Blazor project builds etc. to know a) why the dll isn't handled automatically if Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime is referenced (could be that it ignores native dlls); or b) how best to fix it, but I'd suggest looking for info on how to make sure required dlls are included so they can be loaded at runtime.",

But at that point you could just create a React app or something like that as you lose all the advantages of Blazor (Coding in C# for example) anyway as you can not use any of the .Net parts of the ONNX Runtime but need to do all of the Inferencing in JS.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this could be supported somehow as then we could write Web (WASM) Projects Fully in C# and still do ML tasks.",
