Or is it just not something you even recommend trying?\r\n\r\nWe can use custom ops defined in a native library as the loading methods are exposed, but allowing users to write custom ops in Java would require writing a hook that wraps the user defined Java function into a C struct that we can then wrap with a function pointer that calls back up into the JVM whenever the op is executed. That upcall would need to be bound to an instance of a Java object (or we could bind it to a static method on an object but we'd need a different codepath), and we'd have to marshall all the objects on the way in and out. Upcalls into the JVM are a tricky beast in general as it wants to be able to throw exceptions and the GC can run. And once we'd done all that the performance wouldn't be that great for most use cases due to all the juggling and the lack of stable SIMD primitives in the Java language (at the moment, they are coming though).\r\n\r\nBasically it would be *a lot* of work for not too much gain in my opinion.",

        "body": "Yeah, so more concretely I've been helping an internal user deploy a generative system where the pytorch program was exported as three different ONNX models due to some interactions with the export system and a very complicated model. The different ONNX model chunks need to have their inputs processed in a few different ways as part of the code that linked them together, and at the moment we're looking at writing Java code to process the buffers in between session.run calls. If we could replace that with calls into ORT to execute the equivalent ops that would make things easier (and potentially faster). I'm still not clear if the control flow in the host language is strictly necessary, it may be possible to export the whole pytorch program as one much larger and more complicated ONNX graph, or we may be able to build a set of small ONNX graphs to do the input/output processing but it would be simpler if we can execute these kind of single operations.\r\n\r\nIt's less of a problem for things like the Python binding where numpy or pytorch are available and can more easily interop with ORT, but in Java we don't have good interop with a library that can do small ops for pre/post-processing.",

        "body": "Understood, thanks for responding. I don't have an urgent need for it, though it would provide a nice performance boost to my libraries [ONNX-Scala](https://github.com/EmergentOrder/onnx-scala) and [NDScala](https://github.com/SciScala/NDScala) (via the Java API) and make them very competitive with PyTorch on that front. Sometime in the next few months would be great.\r\n\r\nI have been anticipating and tracking this for a while, from https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/4453 through https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/10548 to https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/10713 , so it was nice to see it land 🎉 , even if it does take a little while to bubble up to Java land.\r\nAppreciate your efforts here. Thanks @orausch , @RandySheriffH , @pranavsharma and (in advance) @Craigacp \r\n\r\nBTW, looks like those first two PRs can now be closed.",
