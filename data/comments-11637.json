We have an API that can auto generate the gradient graph given the forward graph in C++: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/orttraining/orttraining/core/framework/gradient_graph_builder.h#L83\r\n\r\nHowever, this api is not publicly exposed through the training c apis (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/orttraining/orttraining/training_api/include/onnxruntime_training_c_api.h).\r\n\r\nThere could be an update on this in the near future. Please let me know if this would be of help for you.\r\n\r\nSorry for the late response.",
