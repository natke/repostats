Didn't expect it to become 5D at that point.\r\n\r\nThose switches could potentially cause a lot of overhead as you have to move data to/from NPU each time NNAPI is run, which is expensive. I wouldn't expect it to be quite as much as you're seeing though. \r\n\r\nNNAPI performance is somewhat unpredictable as a lot depends on the hardware vendor's implementation. If that is missing operators it will fall back to using a very basic CPU based implementation within NNAPI. One way to test if that is the case is setting the 'cpu only' NNAPI flag. That will fail during model loading if a node assigned to NNAPI would fall back to the slow implementation.\r\n\r\nhttps://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/NNAPI-ExecutionProvider.html#nnapi_flag_cpu_disabled\r\n\r\nYou could also set the log severity to VERBOSE (0) to see additional information about the node placements and where NNAPI is planning on running things. \r\n\r\nhttps://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/c/struct_ort_api.html#ac364c1ca9e610962ba96c37112a36d3e",
