Build onnxruntime from source by yourself. \r\n\r\nNormally when onnxruntime was built from source, the cmake option ['onnxruntime_USE_TELEMETRY'](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/cmake/CMakeLists.txt#L92) is default off, and the \"ENABLE_TELEMETRY\" C macro isn't defined anywhere.  In such a case Microsoft won't collect your data. Our official binaries are built in a special way that has some special extra steps to enable the two things. \r\n\r\n2. You may also consider to disable [Windows Error Reporting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Error_Reporting) if you have concern.  \r\n\r\nThe service is mainly for error reporting. It only uploads data to Microsoft when your program doesn't behave well(like: crash). \r\n\r\nYou may disable the service by setting the following registry value to 1.\r\n```\r\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Error Reporting]\r\n\"Disabled\"=dword:00000001\r\n```\r\n",

When telemetry will be enabled there on the official builds\r\n> \r\n> No.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to let people choose whereas they want to send telemetry. Telemetry already lead to VSCode vs. VSCodium. It would be a shame we'd have to maintain a telemetry free \"onnxruntium\" build in parrallel. \r\n\r\n> The official python package doesn't have telemetry.\r\n\r\nThat's really great, thanks for the precision. maybe it could be precised in the Privacy policy which packages contain telemetry and which don't",

With user consent (configured on their Windows machine), the data will be periodically uploaded to the server, where Microsoft only maintains a sampling of anonymized data compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations. @walrusmcd to keep me honest.
