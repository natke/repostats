        "body": "That's very odd. The logging indicates that it found onnxruntime.dll and loaded it from the classpath, and then found onnxruntime4j_jni.dll and loaded that. Unfortunately the debug logging doesn't have a message that says it correctly loaded the library, but that's the only way for it to proceed. The second load failed with a `Can't find dependent libraries` error, which usually indicates that the onnxruntime was compiled with a provider that it can't find the dll for. The dll name being different for the extracted file didn't cause any issues in the Windows CI pipeline, so I'd be very surprised if it was the name changing.\r\n\r\nWhat arguments did you provide to `build.sh`, and do you have multiple versions of Java on the system? Are there any other dlls in the folder with the `onnxruntime.dll` that you added to `PATH`?",

        "body": "Thanks @Craigacp . Any chance the windows CI pipeline machine somehow will build an `onnxruntime.dll` on `PATH`? I build `rel-1.1.1` branch on windows using `build.bat --config RelWithDebInfo --build_shared_lib --parallel --build_java` and `onnxruntime.dll` is the only extra dll I manually added to `PATH`\r\nThe link command for `onnxruntime4j_jni` shows it is reading `ONNXRUNTIME.LIB` and does that cause a hard dependence on `onnxruntime.dll`? The depencewalker also shows dependence on `onnxruntime.dll`\r\n\r\n[link.command.1.tlog](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/files/4120976/link.command.1.log)\r\n[link.read.1.tlog](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/files/4120977/link.read.1.log)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16123270/73241614-5a3b0900-4157-11ea-9bb3-5af183b12923.png)\r\n\r\n",
