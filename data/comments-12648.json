        "body": "What's the output of `session.getOutputInfo`?\r\n\r\nI don't think any of the APIs support `ONNX_TYPE_UNKNOWN` as it's an error type.  As we don't have a way of wrapping up pointers it's hard to know what we'd do with `ONNX_TYPE_OPAQUE` in Java, so we're unlikely to support that till we migrate to the foreign function API. Sparse tensor support is in this PR #10653.",
