If it's an existing ONNX function that is missing a dedicated kernel in ORT, you can contribute it to ORT. If it's a new function that doesn't exist yet in ONNX, you can propose it in https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues. If you want to just register a new op in ORT - see https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/add-custom-op.html",
