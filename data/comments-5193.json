The odd behaviour is that using taskset to restrict the number of threads used by the python process decreases the inference time ! The less threads, the faster the inference. That is without touching at any point the onnxruntime configuration.\r\n\r\nI did a second experiment where I do use a multithreading library to run inferences in parallel: each separate process uses onnxruntime on a small batch of images. Doing this yield the best performances for the inference on my 64 images. (In this configuration, I set omp_num_threads to (total_number_of_threads / number_of_parallel_threads) to prevent an overuse of the cpus.)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that batching the inference within a single inference using onnxruntime should be faster than this manual parallelization.
