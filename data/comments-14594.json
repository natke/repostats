        "body": "Hi @LucasFischer123. \r\n\r\nI am not very clear on the question here. If you don't mind, would you please elaborate? My question is:\r\n1. Are you looking to perform training of any kind (including quantization aware training) using onnxruntime?\r\n    - for this, we are currently developing a solution and you should use onnxblock and the training apis once the solution is ready.\r\n2. Or are you looking to only do post training quantization (using either static or dynamic quantization)?\r\n    - For this, you should use the onnxruntime quantization tool. More details at https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/quantization.html\r\n3. Or are you looking to build a custom gradient graph based on your onnx model?\r\n    - For this, you can explore using the `GradientGraphBuilder` in onnxruntime: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/orttraining/orttraining/python/orttraining_pybind_state.cc#L800. Let me know if this is what you want, I can provide more examples on how to use this utility.\r\n4. Or something else?\r\n",

        "body": "Hi @baijumeswani \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the quick answer.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to do is closely related to 1). \r\n\r\nWe aren't doing quantization aware training but we need to acquire the gradient at each layer for some kind of post training quantization. So in a nutshell, we need to have some kind of backward propagation and get the gradient. Is it clearer for you ? \r\n\r\nCouple questions, \r\n\r\n1. can we start using onnxblock and the training api right now ? \r\n2. If yes, do you have tutorials or examples that we could use or help you build those blocks ? \r\n3. With the ONNXblock and training api, is it build to be able to work on any kind of neural networks with convolution.\r\n4. Will it work for transformer\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help!",
