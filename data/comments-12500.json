        "body": "Hi @fs-eire,\r\n\r\nI have added my sample implementations for initializing inference session with `Uint8Array` and `ArrayBuffer` for React Native on Android platform to the error reproduction repo (same as the one linked above: [https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-buffer-issue](https://github.com/jackylu0124/ort-react-native-buffer-issue)).\r\n\r\nI have added two different implementations for passing ONNX model buffer data between React Native and Native Java code, and have verified that they load and run inference correctly. One of them uses base64 string encoding and decoding for data passing (please see the `BufferInitializationTestApp_string_fix/` folder) while the other one uses JavaScript's Array to React Native Java's ReadableArray conversion for data passing (please see the `BufferInitializationTestApp_array_fix/` folder). In addition to the main app entry file `App.tsx`, the most important files that I have made changes to are `node_modules/onnxruntime-react-native/android/src/main/java/ai/onnxruntime/reactnative/OnnxruntimeModule.java`, `node_modules/onnxruntime-react-native/lib/backend.ts`, and `node_modules/onnxruntime-react-native/lib/binding.ts`. You can find my changes by searching for comments that start with `// JL`. Note that I only modified the TypeScript files and not the JavaScript files in the other folders because I am working with a TypeScript project, and I also didn't rebuild the entire React Native package. I only modified the aforementioned files for the sake of demonstration.\r\n\r\n**Notes on passing ONNX model data buffer with base64 string encoding and decoding**\r\n1. This approach is in fact how the current package handles passing tensor inputs from React Native JavaScript to Native Java code. Since the package is already doing that for passing tensor data, I don't see a reason why the same can't be done for passing the ONNX model data buffer.\r\n2. For the sake of simplicity, I used the base64 string encoding itself as the session key, but there might be better ways for creating the session key.\r\n\r\n**Notes on passing ONNX model data buffer with JavaScript's Array to React Native Java's ReadableArray conversion**\r\n1. For the sake of simplicity, I used the joined \"stringified\" content of the passed array separated by commas for the session key, but there might be better alternatives for creating the session key.\r\n2. Performance/efficiency of the data transfer brige should not be a concern here because I have tested iterating over an array of 1 billion elements (corresponding to the scenario where the ONNX model is roughly 1 GB), and it still finishes very quickly.\r\n3. In the case of implementation for the native code (Objective C) for iOS (which I didn't add code for), we would use `NSArray`, and the same implementation logic still applies because the `node_modules/onnxruntime-react-native/ios/OnnxruntimeModule.mm` file includes the C++ runtime header file `<onnxruntime/onnxruntime_cxx_api.h>`, which would then allow us to initialize an inference session with the ONNX model data buffer using the C++ API.\r\n4. For passing array from React Native JavaScript to both the Android native Java code and the iOS native Objective C code, I found this StackOverflow post quite helpful: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55514888/how-to-convert-react-js-array-to-nsarray-in-ios-and-string-in-android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55514888/how-to-convert-react-js-array-to-nsarray-in-ios-and-string-in-android).\r\n\r\nFinally, is there any chance you guys could please add official support to the `onnxruntime-react-native` package for initializing inference session with `Uint8Array` and `ArrayBuffer` on both iOS and Android platforms? I would really appreciate your help and the addition of this feature because as mentioned earlier, directly storing and loading the `.ort` model on the mobile device presents great security risks, and buffer storing and loading will greatly mitigate these issues. Thank you very much for your help again and please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.",

I will help do the changes and help check in the pr hopefully this week.\r\n\r\nFor iOS side, so sorry lately haven't had enough time focusing on that. still be in progress. hopefully will send out a pr next week.\r\n\r\nFor all changes to be supported in official ort react native package, it will be included in 1.14 release (planned till next year). but once it's checked in the main repo, you should be able to build from source and try at least.
