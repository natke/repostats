        "body": "Indeed, since I haven't installed the base environment for a long time, I forgot about this little thing, haha. \r\n\r\nI have a small suggestion, for components like TensorRT EP, is it possible to specifically mark the specific version range that CUDA, cuDNN, CUDA can be compatible with, for example, 10.4~11.6 or something like that. I have many programs deployed on my computer, each requiring a different version, and I want to choose a compromise version to install. Using a version that does not meet the requirements will be a variety of magical problems, and it is difficult to find the cause in a short time, very painful haha.",
