        "body": "Unfortunately with limited resources we have to prioritize development on things with the best cost/benefit. Adding a new execution provider has a very high cost in terms of development and maintenance. Having concrete production use cases is one part of the benefit, as is the number of scenarios that would be supported. An execution provider that would only be the preferred option on Android devices limits the benefit. Additionally, executing a model using only GPU on a mobile device can negatively impact device responsiveness, which also reduces the number of scenarios where it's the preferred option.\r\n\r\nTotally agree that NNAPI is inconsistent in terms of performance due to the lower layer of that being implemented by hardware vendors. However, I'd expect that to improve over time with newer devices having better implementations, and if that happens NNAPI would gradually become the preferred option given it can use GPU as well as NPU.\r\n\r\nWe do listen to feedback and are happy to consider expanding the opencl execution provider or adding a Vulkan based one if a case can be made to justify the development and maintenance cost of doing so.",
