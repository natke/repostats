        "body": "Hey @JohnnyLing we were able to reproduce this bug and debug it. As you are running the model on HDDL, openvino internally converts the input from FP32 to FP16, does the computation and when producing the output it will convert it back to FP32. Because of this, we cannot compare the expected FP32 values directly as there will be some accuracy loss. We are going to add model tests for FP16 in the future but for now i suggest we look at the labels and see if the output is correct instead of the raw output numbers themselves. \r\n",
