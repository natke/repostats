        "body": "@faxu, @jignparm Thank you.  Since OnnxRuntime adheres to the NETStandard 1.1, I am hopeful this will work for CPU inferencing on my 3rd-party x64 .NETFramework 4.5 app that compiles its own C# script and can reference external DLLs, but each must be specified individually.  The script I am using is similar to the one provided in the OnnxRuntime C# API docs, but I cannot get the DLLs to load cleanly.\r\n\r\nAs I examine the NuGet package library folders, it is unclear which of the numerous DLLs available are required or which version to use that is compatible with .NETFramework 4.5.  Perhaps there is a better way to identify these or reference them all.  \r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the installation guide and DLL dependencies I see the following:\r\n- NETStandard.Library (>= 1.6.1)\r\n- System.Numerics.Tensors (>= 0.1.0)\r\n- Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms (>= 1.1.0)\r\n- System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation (>= 4.3.0)\r\n- System.Memory (>= 4.5.0)\r\n- System.Buffers (>= 4.4.0)\r\n- System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe (>= 4.5.2)\r\n\r\nand the native runtimes\r\n- onnxruntime.dll\r\n- libiomd.dll\r\n- mklml.dll\r\n\r\nIt is unclear if this is a complete list of required DLLs and when attempting to load this list, the compiler calls for System.Runtime 0.4.0 which, when added, results in duplicate data types with mscorelib.dll.\r\n\r\nAs point of reference, I was able to get the Microsoft CNTK library to work well referencing the correct DLLs based on specific  documentation at this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/CNTK-Library-Evaluation-on-Windows#shipping-cntk-library-with-your-windows-application) and am hoping to do the same with OnnxRuntime to tap into other ML./DL frameworks. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any additional insight you can provide.\r\n\r\n",

For example, if I look in the System.Runtime.4.3.0 folder, there is no DLL in the \"net45\" or \"portable-net45-win8+wp80+wpa81\" subfolders that I would expect to use.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8396992/58834349-2b4cb180-8621-11e9-8448-d09b42be7463.png)\r\n\r\nMy sense is not all of these packages / DLLs are needed so it would be quite useful to have a culled down list of required DLLs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "@jignparm thanks for the additional info.  I did build a release solution in VS 2019 using the sample csharp inferencing code found [HERE](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/csharp/sample/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.InferenceSample/Program.cs) targeting .NETFramework 4.5 so my list of DLLs is different.\r\n\r\nThis generated the following files in \\bin\\release output:\r\nSystem.Memory.dll\r\nSystem.Memory.xml\r\nSystem.Numerics.Tensors.dll\r\nSystem.Numerics.Tensors.xml\r\nSystem.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll\r\nSystem.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.xml\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.dll\r\nMicrosoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.dll\r\nMicrosoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.pdb\r\nSystem.Buffers.dll\r\nSystem.Buffers.xml\r\n\r\nHowever, when referencing the above DLLs from the 3rd Party app and compiling my C# script, I get several errors such as the following suggesting I am missing or have the wrong version of \"System.Runtime, Version=4.0.0.0\"\r\n\r\n> The type   'System.IDisposable' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You   must add a reference to assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.0.0.0,   Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.\r\n\r\nLooking at the lib/ref folders, there are several System.RunTime.dll assemblies listed to choose from (that I have annotated with version number from File Explorer Properties):\r\n\r\n---- System.Runtime.4.3.0\r\n|   \r\n+---lib\r\n|   +---net45\r\n|   |       _._\r\n|   +---net462 \r\n|   |       System.Runtime.dll  (ver. 4.6.24705.01)\r\n|   +---portable-net45+win8+wp80+wpa81\r\n|   |       _._\r\n\\---ref\r\n    +---net45\r\n    |       _._\r\n    +---net462\r\n    |       System.Runtime.dll  (ver. 4.6.24705.01)\r\n    +---netstandard1.0\r\n    |   |   System.Runtime.dll  (ver. 4.0.30319.17929)\r\n    +---netstandard1.2\r\n    |   |   System.Runtime.dll  (ver. 4.0.40013.0)\r\n    +---netstandard1.3\r\n    |   |   System.Runtime.dll  (ver. 4.6.23123.00)\r\n    +---netstandard1.5\r\n    |   |   System.Runtime.dll  (ver. 1.0.24212.1)?\r\n    +---portable-net45+win8+wp80+wpa81\r\n    |       _._\r\n\r\nThe System.Runtime.dll wasn't listed in the bin/release output, although it was the only one listed in the , packages\\System.Runtime.4.3.0\\lib folder so I referenced it and was able to get a clean compile in my 3rd Party app.  I am testing for runtime errors at the moment but am definitely farther along than I was before now that I can debug my C# script in VS 2019 .  Thanks, I will report back. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
