The CPU one enables Link-Time Code Gen. The GPU one could do the same, but I haven't tried.\r\n3. The CPU one use protobuf-lite, the GPU one use the full version of protobuf because TensorRT need it.\r\n4. The CPU one can support ARM , the GPU one haven't.\r\n5. The CPU one can support macOS , the GPU one doesn't. \r\n\r\nThings like this. For example, as long we still have a CPU package, I would not add macOS support to the GPU package. We will not be able to make CUDA working on macOS, I'm saying CPU-only. It makes no sense to make a GPU package without having GPU functionality. \r\n\r\nFrom technical perspective, the CPU package always has its unique value. But as you said, in most cases these things are not important. \r\n\r\n> Could it cause issues having both packages installed at once?\r\n\r\nI believe so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
