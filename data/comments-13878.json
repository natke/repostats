        "body": "Hi, got the same issue and got there. I'm not a Python developer but I managed to solve my issue by adding `delete=False` argument to the call of NamedTemporaryFile of onnxconverter_common/float16.py lib, line 325.  On windows the file seems to be deleted before the lib tries to read it later. I haven't checked if there is an update of onnxconverter_common as I don't have too much time ^^.\r\n\r\nHope this will help",
