Thanks for the reply @Craigacp.\r\n\r\nI'm running ONNX runtime on the Linux server, but I wanted to be able to execute tests on the MacBook Air M1 too for the development purposes. \r\n\r\nI have 2 more questions:\r\n- In case I'd like to compile it on my own, which directory is \"appropriate\"? I mean, where do I need to copy resulting `dylib` you mentioned?\r\n- Do you have any plans to release a `*.jar` artifact for macOS with M1 chip to the central repository, so I could simply add it to my build and parametrize it depending on the operating system on which it's being compiled? Or maybe do you have any plans to make existing artifact multiplatform?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPiotr",

These are included in the official packages and can also be built using \"-arch arm64 -arch x86_64\".``` What packages do have universal binaries?",

Both can be built on x86_64.\r\n\r\nIf the universal binary is not much bigger and we can get it to work on the JVM then it might be better to replace the x86_64 macOS binary in the jar with a universal one (after suitable modification of the Java native loader). However further down in that RocksDB thread there's a note saying enabling it completely broke their Mac JVM build though, so I don't think it's necessarily straightforward.",
