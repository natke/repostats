Just because it doesn't fit the normal node fusion scenarios doesn't mean it wouldn't be valuable, however there should be a unit test and clear explanation of when and how it should be used in a PR that adds it.

        "body": "@skottmckay\r\nI'd be happy to update the PR to add the unit test.\r\n\r\nAs for applicable use-cases: even though strictly speaking performing shape-inference for fused nodes by calling into a custom function during `graph.Resolve()` will have the same end-result as manually setting shape info during graph transforms, doing the latter leads to a weird asymmetry between processing \"normal\" nodes and \"fused ones\" – graph transforms for the former can be agnostic to the input/output shapes, whereas transforms for the latter must explicitly set shape info.\r\n\r\nGiven that it requires < 4 lines of code to add support for this, I think it's worth adding it so graph transforms can be kept as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nEdit: I've updated the PR if you'd like to take a look.",
