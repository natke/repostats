Such issues have almost always ended up with the cause being a quirk of the image pre-processing library they use in C++. You can search for similar past issues in this repo and see if there are solutions that show how to correctly convert your raw image into tensors in C++ based on your model's requirement. Unfortunately, we cannot help with the usage of the image pre-processing library in C++. What I would suggest is to ensure that the raw inputs being fed in via Python and C++ are **exactly the same** and if the outputs then look different, please share your C++ code for us to take a further look.",
