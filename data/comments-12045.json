Looks like the actual bug is that the fusion (to make the Conv node + some other node(s)) shouldn't happen if there is no support for that kernel in the first place. Whether we can enhance the FusedConv kernel to support fp16 is the next question. \r\n\r\nThe default optimization level is ALL, until this is fixed, please make it BASIC and try running the model. It shouldn't trigger this optimization.",

Can you explain to me a little about how does ORT optimize or modify the graph when get a `.onnx` file. I thought ORT just add everything that the `.onnx` file has, but apparently it did many complex modification to the graph, where's the entry point to the graph optimization/modification in this case.
