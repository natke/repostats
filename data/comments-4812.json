        "body": "@jeyblu Unfortunately I don't think there is a fix for this currently. The debugger is being true to the code, in that the provider code does not have internal implementation details, so the debugger doesn't either. The method I've used is to just look at the address of the object you want to see internally, then switch to a stack frame inside the onnxruntime core code and cast it to the type. Since that stack frame is in code that knows the full type information, the debugger will show it.\r\n\r\nA few more of the types are now shared with the internal code, like the IExecutionProvder and the IAllocator types. So these will now 'just work'. But types like 'GraphViewer' cannot.",
