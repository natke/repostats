        "body": "Typically, the error message should tell what shape onnxruntime was expecting and what was provided. Do you have an error message that you can share? This kind of error usually happens at graph inputs, and is uncommon to happen at intermediate nodes in the graph.\r\n\r\nIf you want to analyze the onnx model for intermediate tensor shapes, you could ask onnxruntime to save the final onnx model that onnxruntime will use for execution. This should have the necessary shape inference done and you should be able to analyze the symbolic shapes of the intermediate tensors.\r\n\r\nTo do this, you should [set the optimized file path on the session options](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/c/struct_ort_1_1detail_1_1_session_options_impl.html#af2221c3d556809e321eb2d237a268a2c).\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a better way to do this that I am unaware of. But you could give this a try.",
