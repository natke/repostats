        "body": "Hi Tim, \r\n\r\nthank you. It makes sense that this is JIT related. \r\n\r\nI believe I used the same VM spec for both versions. The only difference is that back then we didn't find nvtx annotations for individual ops, so we added our own [patch](https://github.com/jupvfranco/onnxruntime/tree/nvtx), but I believe this is unrelated. \r\n\r\nHere's 3 training steps of mnist with a recent version of ort. It is interesting because the first training step is not thousands of times slower than the rest of the steps. However, there is a long cudaEventDestroy in between steps. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6861114/99280645-7a909d00-2829-11eb-8cb4-64f6d5eee043.png)\r\n\r\nLooking at a bert-tiny from August, we also see that the first training step takes longer than the remaining ones. The slowdown is not as bad as in the mnist case though. Could this be related with the size of the model? \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6861114/99278766-6055bf80-2827-11eb-821f-7dea84bce9dc.png)\r\n\r\nAs we discussed before, I'm not blocked on this. I'll ignore the first training step anyway when profiling. Feel free to close this issue, if you think we shouldn't investigate it further. \r\n",
