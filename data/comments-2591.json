How about `ExcludeSymbolsFromSingleFile` property as an alternative?\r\n\r\n```csproj\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <IncludeSymbolsInSingleFile>true</IncludeSymbolsInSingleFile>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option might be to write a custom function to remove the pdb file after restoring NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nEven if pdb files are not used in general (debugging is usually a rare case), NuGet packages are allowed to contain them. If there's an easy work around for WPF applications, by using the property tags above or else auto-deleting the pdb files after installation, it would be a better route than dropping the symbols files entirely (or shipping them in different packages).\r\n\r\n",
