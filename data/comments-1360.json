        "body": "Thanks for your response. \r\n\r\nSorry, I forgot to mention that the values in the 'lengths' vector should contain the lengths of the sequences after being processed by the two CNN layers, just before being input to the LSTM. Hence, the original values should be divided by 4 (the lengths of the original sequences must be multiple of 4), which is the CNN granularity . In your experiment, the value in 'lengths' should be 5 (20/4). \r\n\r\nI have tried the same model on branches created from different commits. The code corresponding to the commit a92998c235ee280013ac6ee0fd304a7458b4d0c8\r\n\r\n```\r\nCommit a92998c2\r\nby Dmitri Smirnov, 06/10/2019 11:36 PM\r\ncommitted by GitHub\r\nparent f72c1501\r\nUncomment ConstantOfShape tests. (#1059)\r\n\r\n```\r\nalready manifests the issue. On the other hand, the code from commit 7cd2d9f3c41ede8427fb5c4270eceae678e8638a works as expected\r\n\r\n```\r\nCommit 7cd2d9f3\r\nby Ryan Hill, 06/05/2019 08:05 PM\r\ncommitted by GitHub\r\nparent 7c4494a0\r\nchild c6abb17b\r\n\r\nChange Path_lib to not use Shlwapi.dll if compiled as WINAPI_PARTITION_APP (#1161)\r\n```\r\nAside from the issue with reshape, I think that there are more problems in the model and/or ORT. In order to get a decent performance I have to compile the library without MKLML\r\n\r\n`build.bat --config RelWithDebInfo --use_mkldnn --use_cuda --build_shared_lib  --cudnn_home %CUDNN_PATH% --cuda_home \"%CUDA_PATH%\"`\r\n\r\nWhen I compile with MKLML\r\n\r\n`build.bat --config RelWithDebInfo --use_mkldnn --use_mklml --use_cuda --build_shared_lib  --cudnn_home %CUDNN_PATH% --cuda_home \"%CUDA_PATH%\"`\r\n\r\nit takes minutes for a single inference, and the execution is mostly concentrated in a spin lock (BTW, wouldn't a condition variable be more appropriate in this case as the operations are not trivial?)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrnn_helpers.h, line 241\r\n\r\nint totalTasks = max / (step > 0 ? step : 1) + (max % step > 0 ? 1 : 0);\r\nwhile (done != totalTasks) ;\r\n```\r\nIn addition, when I run the model on GPU the accuracy is much worse than with CPU. I am compiling the library with support for CUDA 10.1, and this problem does not occur when I use the same library on other models.\r\n",

However, I think there is something wrong in the GPU implementation. When supplied with a tensor containing sequences of varying lengths the output of the GPU provider is very different from the one obtained with CPU. The divergence corresponding to the longest sequence is the batch is small, though.\r\n\r\n This occurs in all branches I have tested, including the current master branch. I am sure that the GPU implementation is the one that has the problem because when compared to the ground truth, the error of the CPU provider is of the same order as the one I got from PyTorch during training. In addition, when using batches containing a single sequence the results obtained from both GPU and CPU providers are comparable.\r\n\r\nAnother observation I would like to make is that when evaluating the model on GPU using the code in master, the execution takes a 50% longer than when employing the code pulled from commit 7cd2d9f3c41ede8427fb5c4270eceae678e8638a, for instance.\r\n",
