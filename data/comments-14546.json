        "body": "from your description, it sounds like an internal issue with TensorRT that impacts certain GPU HW configs. \r\nI haven't encountered this specific error before. It's interesting that it works okay on Titan X but not on the other HW.\r\nMaybe it's memory related? (Titan X has more GPU memory than P4000 and Jetson Xavier)\r\nWe will soon be releasing ORT 1.14 which supports TensorRT 8.5, maybe you can try that on your P4000? \r\nif you're able to build from source, you can build main branch. or wait until the 1.14 binary packages are released.",

We were trying to prepare a reproducer or debug it properly. \r\n\r\nWe found that the reported different behavior was due to some inaccuracies in our infrastructure. After adjustments in infrastructure we found that tiny yoloX model was invalid for all architectures (Quadro P4000, TITAN X, Jetson).\r\n\r\nWe go deeper to the mmdetection and mmdeploy, that is responsible for train/export, and we found that problem was in the export\r\n\r\n```\r\npython mmdeploy/tools/deploy.py \\\r\n    mmdeploy/configs/mmdet/detection/detection_onnxruntime_dynamic.py \\\r\n    $CONFIG_FILE \\\r\n    $file \\\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nchange to static\r\n\r\n```\r\npython mmdeploy/tools/deploy.py \\\r\n    mmdeploy/configs/mmdet/detection/detection_onnxruntime_static.py \\\r\n    $CONFIG_FILE \\\r\n    $file \\\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter this, we had to call \r\n\r\n```\r\npython onnxruntime/python/tools/symbolic_shape_infer.py --input $MODEL_PATH --output $MODEL_PATH --auto_merge\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, it is working on all platforms.\r\n\r\n",
