        "body": "@boydjohnson Thank you for your opinion.\r\nIn my opinion, I think it does not necessarily have to be released high-level onnxruntime. \r\nHowever, I think it would be preferable to release thin wrapper.\r\n\r\n> What are your thoughts on what is not quite right with the high-level bindings?\r\n\r\n## Here is things that is not right about the high-level bindings.\r\n### function name is not correctly corresponds 1 on 1 to sys API.\r\nI guress function name is too abstract.\r\ne.g.  [with_number_threads](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/12606/files#diff-d1183c6419c1427b1b49981b98da11ce418f1e49556fe46ccb25e0f1eb78cae8R106-R116) actually calls `SetIntraOpNumThreads` function in `with_number_threads` .  \r\nAnd `onnxruntime` has `SetInterOpNumThreads` function. \r\nSo I changed onnxruntime `with_number_threads` function to `with_intra_op_num_threads` and `with_inter_op_num_threads`  in [VOICEVOX/onnxruntime-rs](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/onnxruntime-rs)\r\nhttps://github.com/VOICEVOX/onnxruntime-rs/blob/master/onnxruntime/src/session.rs#L112-L126\r\n\r\n### depends on rust-ndarray \r\nIt is similar opinion by @Qinka.\r\nRust already has multiple type n-dimensional array libraries in crates.io.\r\nAnd I think user should be able to choose among those n-dimensional array libraries.  \r\nOf course onnxruntime-rs can provide as cargo feature base selection, If you want high-level onnxruntime API.\r\nHowever, considering the transition of the libraries, I think it is better that provide more low API.\r\nAnd onnxruntime-rs can not passing any dimension arrays like [Session::run](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/12606/files#diff-d1183c6419c1427b1b49981b98da11ce418f1e49556fe46ccb25e0f1eb78cae8R376-R386) .\r\nSo I modified it to be able to [pass any dimension array in VOICEVOX/onnxruntime-rs](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/onnxruntime-rs/blob/master/onnxruntime/src/session.rs#L445-L471)\r\n\r\n\r\n## And here is a summary of the  wrapper bindings I want.\r\n### Thin wrapper but safety guaranteed\r\nTo avoid depends on rust-ndarray.\r\ne.g. [Session::run](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/12606/files#diff-d1183c6419c1427b1b49981b98da11ce418f1e49556fe46ccb25e0f1eb78cae8R376-R386) `pub fn run(&self,input_arrays:Vec<Array<TIn, D>>)` to `pub fn run(&self,input_data: &[D])` .\r\nIt is able to because it pass pointer to raw `run` function in the end.\r\n\r\n### function name should be corresponds 1 on 1 sys API function\r\nIt is necessary to rename the function names like `with_number_threads`.\r\nI believe there are still similar names.\r\n\r\n",
