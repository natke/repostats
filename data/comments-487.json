That change behavior and the model start give different results but these results are almost wrong. Probably I need to create that issues in customvision github repo.\r\n\r\nUPD.\r\nI`ve tried that model in UWP app and it seems its working fine there. it seems I'm passing the image to the model in the wrong way or onnxruntime working incorrectly. \r\n\r\nUPD2.\r\nOMG I`ve found the problem. CustomVision internally scale image to 227x227. But they doing it just using the crop in the center from the original image. I think that thing should definitely somewhere documented and hinted. And I think the image should not be cropped cause it will lose a lot of information.",
