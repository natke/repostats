As per the spec the subgraph is called with the iteration number as the first input. See the description of the 'body' attribute [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#attributes-37)\r\n\r\nIt is possible to add the trip_count to the input by referencing it as an outer scope variable. If you wish to do that the input to the Add node in the subgraph should be '2' (the constant in the main graph with the trip count) instead of 'i.1' (the current iteration passed as the first input to the subgraph.",
