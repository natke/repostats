Furthermore the datastructures are blown up x3 without any information gain. \r\n\r\nBeeing able to process the data in the same format as it is received improves the thruput.\r\n\r\nFurthermore this is possible with the CUDA and CPU providers. For many operations (e.g. PAD, RESIZE) onnx-runtime/onnx-trt is able to fallback to another provider when the operation is supported but not with the given parameters, hence my understanding is that this could be done the same way for casts.\r\n",
