By a cursory glance, just removing that check should be enough (a test can validate this).",

        "body": "I filed this bug report because on my team we were discussing the semantics of tile() in ONNX and the argument was raised that it's not supposed to work for scalars because the CPU implementation raises an error in this case. Ultimately the spec implies that scalars are allowed (\"input tensor of any shape\") and the GPU implementation doesn't seem to have this problem, so it seems clear that scalars are allowed. Except, the CPU implementation does have this error. So probably that's just a CPU-only bug. So I'm telling you about a legitimate bug, but also there is an informational point to probe how ONNX is supposed to work. I'm not working on ONNX, have never compiled it or run any of the tests, so I'd not be looking to fix this myself at this time. Though I am curious to know the answer to whether this is supposed to work for scalars or not. :)",
