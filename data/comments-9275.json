        "body": "Ort::Value are move only shallow classes that essentially serve as std::unique_ptr with some convenience methods. \r\nSo std::move() would work well. That is, if that is what you wanted.  The issue here, is that's the value that is bound to output and you seem to want to account for that as input. \r\nI suggest you bind that value as input first (that would clear the original binding), that way you will be able to feed output  buffer to input. Then move it to tf->bound_r1i (that would release the originally bound Ort::Value() stored in tf->bound_r1i).\r\nThen rebind the output again. You can do so in the loop. \r\nHad you known the output shape beforehand, you could have two buffers rotating them between input/output.",
