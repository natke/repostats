        "body": "@fs-eire, do you have usage data/feedback which supports your second point? I'd guess that this is not the case for most users. IIRC, a `postMessage` takes less than a millisecond (unless the data is huge - but in that case transferable objects should help keep it on the order of a few milliseconds at most).\r\n\r\nRE your first point, I wouldn't have thought that the creation of a webworker would be a breaking change, since it seems like just an implementation detail that can't break existing code (though it could slow it down by a millisecond or so for some users - RE your second point).\r\n\r\nIIUC, the third point doesn't preclude the proxy mode from being the default.\r\n\r\nThinking about this from a user experience perspective, I think it makes sense for the defaults to match what the vast majority of users would want. If you have data/feedback to suggest that most users have models that inference in just a few milliseconds (and have super low latency as a strong requirement), then I think the current situation is a good default, but if not (and if you can't change it for v1), then I hope you'll consider changing it for v2. Otherwise, please feel free to close this.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply!",

I.e. just track start and end time of synchronous main-thread computations and check if it's too long. IIRC, Emscripten does this already, but it won't give a useful warning that includes directing user to use `ort.env.wasm.proxy`.",
