At the time we introduced th prepacked weights container, we did not have such a use-case and hence this ctor was not added. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh I see what you mean now. I think you are stating that the C API has it but the C++ API doesn't expose that ctor. We will add it for the next release. Thank you !",
