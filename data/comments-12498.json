        "body": "Hi, I was hitting the same problem in our use of ONNX Runtime at Unity, but with a batch count > 1. When the support for ConvAdd fusion was added, MlasConvGemmDirectThreaded was not updated to use the beta parameter but is still hard-coded to 0.0f. The MlasConvAlgorithmDepthwise path was also not updated to use beta, but that might be trickier: maybe the code should not select that path if beta is non-zero.\r\n\r\nThe other important part of this is that I was running on a M1, so the NCHWc path was not selected and the ConvAdd fusion was used. I can work around locally by setting the optimization level to -o 2.",
