I believe that nvml.dll gets installed along with the NVIDIA display driver, though.\r\n\r\nYou can extract cudnn64_7.dll and cudart64_91.dll from the temp folder that the CUDA installer unpacks the installation files to at the start of the installation process.\r\n\r\nI also had to add my app in the NVIDIA \"Manage 3D Settings->Program Settings\" and set the preferred graphics processor to HIGH-performance NVIDIA processor since I have an integrated graphics card besides the NVIDIA one.",
