        "body": "I'm not familiar with the new optimizer code. Maybe @tianleiwu can comment on that. Looks like that was added with the intention of usage on GPU only so there's no CPU kernel.\r\n\r\nWhen running on Android the NNAPI or XNNPACK EP will do a runtime conversion from the default ONNX NCHW layout to NHWC for the nodes that EP will take. If there was a normal Conv it would be able to take it. It's not aware of or looking for any custom ops, so it wouldn't know how to run an NhwcConv. Due to that we probably do not want to be inserting NhwcConv nodes if the model is intended for usage on Android.",
